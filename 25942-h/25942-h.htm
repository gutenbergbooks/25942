<h3><a name = "preface" id = "preface">PREFACE</a></h3>


<p><span class = "firstword">The</span> following pages are designed to
give a historical and critical account of all that has been done in the
way of translating <i>Beowulf</i> from the earliest attempts of Sharon
Turner in 1805 down to the present time. As a corollary to this, it
presents a history of the text of the poem to the time of the
publication of Grein’s <i>Bibliothek der angelsächsischen Poesie</i> in
1859; for until the publication of this work every editor of the poem
was also its translator.</p>

<p>It is hoped that the essay may prove useful as a contribution to
bibliography, and serve as a convenient reference book for those in
search of information regarding the value of texts and translations of
<i>Beowulf</i>.</p>

<p>The method of treating the various books is, in general, the same.
I&nbsp;have tried to give in each case an accurate bibliographical
description of the volume, a&nbsp;notion of the value of the text used
in making it, &amp;c. But the emphasis given to these topics has
necessarily varied from time to time. In discussing literal
translations, for example, much attention has been paid to the value of
the text, while little or nothing is said of the value of the rendering
as literature. On the other hand, in the case of a book which is
literary in aim, the attention paid to the critical value of the book is
comparatively small. At certain periods in the history of the poem, the
chief value of a translation is its utility as a part of the critical
apparatus for the
<span class = "pagenum">4</span>
interpretation of the poem; at other periods, a&nbsp;translation lays
claim to our attention chiefly as imparting the literary features of the
original.</p>

<p>In speaking of the translations which we may call literary,
I&nbsp;have naturally paid most attention to the English versions, and
this for several reasons. In the first place, <i>Beowulf</i> is an
<i>English</i> poem; secondly, the number, variety, and importance of
the English translations warrant this emphasis; thirdly, the present
writer is unable to discuss in detail the literary and metrical value of
translations in foreign tongues. The account given of German, Dutch,
Danish, Swedish, French, and Italian versions is, therefore, of a more
strictly bibliographical nature; but, whenever possible, some notion has
been given of the general critical opinion with regard to them.</p>

<p>An asterisk is placed before the titles of books which the present
writer has not seen.</p>

<p>My thanks are due to the officials of the Library of Yale University,
who secured for me many of the volumes here described; to Professor
Ewald Flügel of Leland Stanford Junior University, who kindly lent me
certain transcripts made for him at the British Museum; and to Mr.
Edward Thorstenberg, Instructor in Swedish at Yale University, for help
in reading the Danish and Swedish translations.</p>

<div class = "maintext">

<h3><a name = "prelim" id = "prelim">PRELIMINARY REMARKS ON THE<br>
BEOWULF MANUSCRIPT</a></h3>

<p><span class = "firstword">The</span> unique manuscript of the
<i>Beowulf</i> is preserved in the Cottonian Library of the British
Museum. It is contained in the folio designated Cotton Vitellius A. xv,
where it occurs ninth in order, filling the folios numbered 129a to
198b, inclusive.</p>

<p>The first recorded notice of the MS. is to be found in Wanley’s
Catalog of Anglo-Saxon Manuscripts (Oxford, 1705), Volume III of
Hickes’s <i>Thesaurus</i>. The poem is thus described:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
‘Tractatus nobilissimus Poeticè scriptus. Præfationis hoc est initium.’
</blockquote>

<p>The first nineteen lines follow, transcribed with a few errors.</p>

<blockquote>
‘Initium autem primi Capitis sic se habet.’
</blockquote>

<p>Lines 53&ndash;73, transcribed with a few errors.</p>

<blockquote>
‘In hoc libro, qui Poeseos Anglo-Saxonicæ egregium est exemplum,
descripta videntur bella quæ Beowulfus quidam Danus, ex Regio
Scyldingorum stirpe Ortus, gessit contra Sueciæ Regulos.’ Page 218, col.
b, and 219, col.&nbsp;a.
</blockquote>

<p>No further notice was taken of the MS. until 1786, when Thorkelin<a
class = "tag" name = "tag_prelim1" id = "tag_prelim1" href =
"#note_prelim1">1</a> made two transcripts of&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>In 1731 there occurred a disastrous fire which destroyed a number of
the Cottonian MSS. The Beowulf MS. suffered at this time, its edges
being scorched and its pages shriveled. As a result, the edges have
chipped
<span class = "pagenum">8</span>
away, and some of the readings have been lost. It does not appear,
however, that these losses are of so great importance as the remarks of
some prominent Old English scholars might lead us to suspect. Their
remarks give the impression that the injury which the MS. received in
the fire accounts for practically all of the illegible lines. That this
is not so may be seen by comparing the Wanley transcript with the
Zupitza <i>Autotypes</i>. Writing in 1705, before the Cotton fire,
Wanley found two illegible words at line 15&mdash;illegible because of
fading and rubbing. Of exactly the same nature appear to be the injuries
at lines 2220&nbsp;ff., the celebrated passage which is nearly, if not
quite, unintelligible. It would therefore be a safe assumption that such
injuries as these happened to the MS. before it became a part of the
volume, Vitellius A. xv. The injuries due to scorching and burning are
seldom of the first importance.</p>

<p>This point is worth noting. Each succeeding scholar who transcribed
the MS., eager to recommend his work, dwelt upon the rapid deterioration
of the parchment, and the reliability of his own readings as exact
reproductions of what he himself had seen in the MS. before it reached
its present ruinous state. The result of this was that the emendations
of the editor were sometimes accepted by scholars and translators as the
authoritative readings of the MS., when in reality they were nothing but
gratuitous additions. This is especially true of Thorpe<a class = "tag"
name = "tag_prelim2" id = "tag_prelim2" href = "#note_prelim2">2</a>,
and the false readings which he introduced were never got rid of until
the Zupitza <i>Autotypes</i> brought to light the sins of the various
editors of the poem. These statements regarding text and MS. will be
developed in the following sections of the paper<a class = "tag" name =

<h5>Points of Difference between the Various Editions.</h5>

<p>A part of this may be stated in the words of the author:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
‘The poem had remained untouched and unnoticed both here and abroad
until I observed its curious contents, and in 1805 announced it to the
public. I&nbsp;could then give it only a hasty perusal, and from the MS.
having a leaf interposed near its commencement, which belonged to a
subsequent part, and from the peculiar obscurity which sometimes attends
the Saxon poetry, I&nbsp;did not at that time sufficiently comprehend
it, and had not leisure to apply a closer attention. But in the year
1818 I took it up again, as I was preparing my third edition, and then
made that more correct analysis which was inserted in that and the
subsequent editions, and which is also exhibited in the present.’
&mdash;Sixth edition, p.&nbsp;293, footnote.
</blockquote>

<span class = "pagenum">10</span>
<p>The statement that the poem had remained untouched and unnoticed is
not strictly true. The public had not yet received any detailed
information regarding it; but Wanley<a class = "tag" name =
"tag_turner1" id = "tag_turner1" href = "#note_turner1">1</a> had
mentioned the <i>Beowulf</i> in his catalog, and Thorkelin had already
made two transcripts of the poem, and was at work upon an edition.
Turner, however, deserves full credit for first calling the attention of
the English people to the importance of the poem.</p>

<p>In the third edition, of which the author speaks, many improvements
were introduced into the digest of the story and some improvements into
the text of the translations. Many of these were gleaned from the
<i>editio princeps</i> of Thorkelin<a class = "tag" name = "tag_turner2"
id = "tag_turner2" href = "#note_turner2">2</a>. The story is now told
with a fair degree of accuracy, although many serious errors remain:
e.g. the author did not distinguish the correct interpretation of the
swimming-match, an extract of which is given below. The translations are
about as faulty as ever, as may be seen by comparing the two extracts.
In the first edition only the first part of the poem is treated; in the
third, selections from the second part are added.</p>

<p>No further changes were made in later editions of the History.</p>

<p>Detailed information regarding differences between the first three

<p>Sharon Turner (1768&ndash;1847) was from early youth devoted to the
study of Anglo-Saxon history, literature, and antiquities. His knowledge
was largely derived from the examination of original documents in the
British Museum<a class = "tag" name = "tag_turner3" id = "tag_turner3"
href = "#note_turner3">3</a>. But the very wealth of the new material
which he found for the study of the literature kept him from making a
thorough study of it. It is to be remembered
<span class = "pagenum">11</span>
that at this time but little was known of the peculiar nature of the Old
English poetry. Turner gives fair discussions of the works of Bede and
Ælfric, but he knows practically nothing of the poetry. With the
so-called <i>Paraphrase</i> of Cædmon he is, of course, familiar; but
his knowledge of <i>Beowulf</i> and <i>Judith</i> is derived from the
unique, and at that time (1805) unpublished, MS., Cotton Vitellius A.
xv. Of the contents of the Exeter Book he knew nothing. The Vercelli
Book had not yet been discovered. The materials at hand for his study
were a faulty edition of Cædmon and an insufficient dictionary. The
author, whose interest was of course primarily in history, was not
familiar with the linguistic work of the day. It is, therefore, not
surprising that his work was not of the best quality.</p>

<h5><a name = "trans_turner_account" id = "trans_turner_account">
Turner’s Account of Beowulf in the First Edition of his
History.</a></h5>

<blockquote>
‘The most interesting remains of the Anglo-Saxon poetry which time has
suffered to reach us, are contained in the Anglo-Saxon poem in the
Cotton Library, Vitellius A. 15. Wanley mentions it as a poem in which
“seem to be described the wars which one Beowulf, a&nbsp;Dane of the
royal race of the Scyldingi, waged against the reguli of Sweden<a class
= "tag" name = "tag_turner4" id = "tag_turner4" href =
"#note_turner4">4</a>.” But this account of the contents of the MS. is
incorrect. It is a composition more curious and important. It is a
narration of the attempt
<span class = "pagenum">12</span>
of Beowulf to wreck the fæthe or deadly feud on Hrothgar, for a homicide
which he had committed. It may be called an Anglo-Saxon epic poem. It
abounds with speeches which Beowulf and Hrothgar and their partisans
make to each other, with much occasional description and sentiment.’
&mdash;Book vi, chap. iv, pp. 398&nbsp;ff.
</blockquote>


<h5>The Story of the Poem as Interpreted by Turner.</h5>

<p class = "center smaller">
[Dots indicate the position of the quotations.]</p>

<p>‘It begins with a proemium, which introduces its hero Beowulf to our
notice.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The poet then states the embarkation of
Beowulf and his partisans.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.’ Turner interprets the
prolog as the description of the embarkation of Beowulf on a piratical
expedition. The accession of Hrothgar to the throne of the Danes is then
described, and the account of his ‘homicide’ is given. This remarkable
mistake was caused by the transposition of a sheet from a later part of
the poem&mdash;the fight with Grendel&mdash;to the first section of the
poem. The sailing of Beowulf and the arrival in the Danish land are then
given. Turner continues: ‘The sixth section exhibits Hrothgar’s
conversation with his nobles, and Beowulf’s introduction and address to
him. The seventh section opens with Hrothgar’s answer to him, who
endeavours to explain the circumstance of the provocation. In the eighth
section a new speaker appears, who is introduced, as almost all the
personages in the poem are mentioned, with some account of his parentage
and character.’ Then follows the extract given below:</p>

<div class = "verse">

<p>Yet on the watery domain</p>

</div>

<p>After this extract, Turner continues:&mdash; ‘It would occupy too
much room in the present volume to give a further account of this
interesting poem, which well deserves to be submitted to the public,
with a translation and with ample notes. There are forty-two sections of
it in the Cotton MS., and it ends there imperfectly. It is perhaps the
oldest poem of an epic form in the vernacular language of Europe which
now exists.’</p>

<span class = "pagenum">14</span>
<p>In the second edition the following lines were added:&mdash;</p>

<p>‘After Hunferthe, another character is introduced:</p>

<p>‘Hunferth, “the son of Ecglaf, who sat at the feet of the lord of the

<h5>Criticism of the Extracts.</h5>

<p>Detailed criticism of the extracts is unnecessary. They are, of
course, utterly useless to-day. Sufficient general criticism of the work
is found in the preceding sections devoted to a discussion of the author
and his knowledge of Old English and of the <i>Beowulf</i>.</p>

<p>In the third edition the author presents some criticisms of
Thorkelin’s text; but his own work is quite as faulty as the
Icelander’s, and his ‘corrections’ are often misleading.</p>

<p>Turner is to be censured for allowing an account of <i>Beowulf</i> so
full of inaccuracy to be reprinted year after year with no attempt at
its improvement or even a warning to the public that it had been
superseded by later and more scholarly studies.</p>

<h5>Circumstances of Publication.</h5>

<p>The words of Wanley cited above<a class = "tag" name =
"tag_thorkelin1" id = "tag_thorkelin1" href = "#note_thorkelin1">1</a>
did not pass unnoticed in Denmark. Thorkelin tells us in his
introduction that it had long been the desire of Suhm<a class = "tag"
name = "tag_thorkelin2" id = "tag_thorkelin2" href =
"#note_thorkelin2">2</a>, Langebeck, Magnusen, and other Danish scholars
to inspect the MS. in the British Museum. The following is Thorkelin’s
account of his editorial labors:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
‘Via tandem mihi data fuit ad desideratum nimis diu divini vatis Danici
incomparabile opus. Arcta etenim, quæ nos et Britannos intercessit
amicitia, me allexit, ut, clementissime annuentibus Augustissimis patriæ
patribus <span class = "smallcaps">Christiano VII.</span> et <span class
= "smallcaps">Frederico VI.</span> iter in Britanniam anno seculi
præteriti <span class = "smallroman">LXXXVI</span>. ad thesauros
bibliothecarum Albionensium perscrutandos facerem.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
A&nbsp;curatoribus, Musæi Britannici, aliarumque Bibliothecarum,
potestas mihi data [est] inspiciendi, tractandi, et exscribendi omnia,
quæ rebus Danicis lucem affere possent manuscripta. Ad quam rem
conficiendam viri nostro præconio majores Josephus Planta et Richardus
Southgate dicti Musæi Brit. præfecti in me sua officia humanissime
contulerunt. Optimo igitur successu et uberrimo cum fructu domum
reversus sum&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.’ (pp. viii,&nbsp;ix).
</blockquote>

<p>Thorkelin thus obtained two copies of the poem, one made with his own
hand, the other by a scribe ignorant of Old English. These transcripts
(still preserved in Copenhagen) formed the basis for Thorkelin’s
edition. The account of his studies continues:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
‘Quæcunque igitur possent hoc meum negotium adjuvare, comparare coepi,
magnamque librorum copiam unde quaque congessi, quorum opera carmen
aggrederer. In hoc me sedulum ita gessi, ut opus totum anno <span class
= "smallroman">MDCCCVII</span> confecerim, idem brevi
editurus&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.’ (p.&nbsp;xv).
</blockquote>

<p>Just at this time, unfortunately, Copenhagen was stormed by the
English fleet, and Thorkelin’s text and notes were
<span class = "pagenum">17</span>
burned with his library. But the transcripts were saved. Thorkelin
renewed his labors under the patronage of Bülow, and at length published
in 1815.</p>


<h5>Thorkelin, and his Interpretation of the Beowulf.</h5>

<p>Grimus Johnssen Thorkelin (or Thorkelsson), 1752&ndash;1829, is
remembered as a scholar in early Germanic history. He had little beside
this knowledge and his general acquaintance with Old Germanic languages
to recommend him as an editor of the <i>Beowulf</i>. Grundtvig said that
the transcript of the <i>Beowulf</i> must have been the work of one
wholly ignorant of Old English<a class = "tag" name = "tag_thorkelin3"
id = "tag_thorkelin3" href = "#note_thorkelin3">3</a>. Thorkelin knew
nothing of the peculiar style of Old English poetry; he could recognize
neither kenning, metaphor, nor compound. He was not even fitted to
undertake the transcription of the text, as the following section will
make evident.</p>

<p>We have seen how Sharon Turner<a class = "tag" name =
"tag_thorkelin4" id = "tag_thorkelin4" href = "#note_thorkelin4">4</a>
could describe the <i>Beowulf</i>. Thorkelin seems to have been little
better fitted to understand the poem, to say nothing of editing it. He
failed to interpret some of the simplest events of the story. He did not
identify Scyld, nor understand that his body was given up to the sea,
but thought that King Beowulf ‘expeditionem suscipit navalem.’ He failed
to identify Breca, and thought that Hunferth was describing some
piratical voyage of Beowulf’s. He makes Beowulf reply that ‘piratas
ubique persequitur et fudit,’ and ‘Finlandiæ arma infert<a class = "tag"
name = "tag_thorkelin5" id = "tag_thorkelin5" href =
"#note_thorkelin5">5</a>.’ He regarded Beowulf as the hero of the
Sigemund episode. He quite misapprehended the Finn episode, ‘Fin, rex
Frisionum, contra Danis pugnat; vincitur; fœdus cum Hrodgaro pangit;
fidem frangit; pugnans cadit<a class = "tag" name = "tag_thorkelin6" id
= "tag_thorkelin6" href = "#note_thorkelin6">6</a>.’ He regards Beowulf
and a son of Hunferth as participating
<span class = "pagenum">18</span>
in that expedition. He failed to identify Hnæf, or Hengest, or Hrothulf,
&amp;c.</p>

<h5>Criticism of the Text.</h5>

among the simplest in the poem, and call for no emendation. In passages
that present any real difficulty, Thorkelin is, if possible, even more
at fault.</p>

<p>In the composition of his text Thorkelin made all the errors known to
scribes and editors. He misread words and letters of the MS., although
he had two transcripts. He dropped letters, combinations of letters, and
even whole words. He joined words that had no relation to each other; he
broke words into two or even three parts; he ignored compounds. He
produced many forms the like of which cannot be found in Old English.
One further example of his great carelessness may be given. The first
line of the poem, which is written in large capitals in
the&nbsp;MS.:&mdash;</p>

<p class = "verse">
Hwæt we Gardena. . . .</p>

<p>Thorkelin perversely transcribed:&mdash;</p>

<p class = "verse">
Hwæt wegar Dena. . . .</p>

<p>and for this combination of syllables he chose the
translation:&mdash;</p>

<p class = "verse">
Quomodo Danorum.</p>

<p>There is, of course, no such word as ‘wegar’ in Old English.</p>

<p>Of the necessity of punctuation Thorkelin seems to have been serenely
unconscious; he did not even follow the guides afforded by the MS. Had
he done so, he would have saved himself many humiliating errors. For
example, in the text given above, to have noticed the periods mentioned
in the collation would have been to avoid two glaring instances of
‘running-in.’</p>


<h5>Criticism of the Translation.</h5>

<p>But, in spite of the wretched text, it remained for the translation
to discover the depths of Thorkelin’s ignorance. It will be seen by
reading the extract given from the
<span class = "pagenum">21</span>
translation that he did not even perceive that two men were swimming in
the sea. It is to be remembered, too, that his error of the ‘piratical
expedition’ is carried on for sixty lines&mdash;certainly a triumph of
ingenuity. It is useless to attempt a classification of the errors in
this version. In the words of Kemble:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
‘Nothing but malevolence could cavil at the trivial errors which the
very best scholars are daily found to commit, but the case is widely
different when those errors are so numerous as totally to destroy the
value of a work. I&nbsp;am therefore most reluctantly compelled to state
that not five lines of Thorkelin’s edition can be found in succession in
which some gross fault, either in the transcription or translation, does
not betray the editor’s utter ignorance of the Anglo-Saxon language.’
&mdash;Edition of 1835, Introd., p.&nbsp;xxix.
</blockquote>


<h5>Reception of Thorkelin’s Edition.</h5>

<p>The book was of value only in that it brought Beowulf to the
attention of scholars. The edition was used by Turner, Grundtvig, and
Conybeare. I&nbsp;have found the following notices of the book, which
will show how it was received by the scholarly world.</p>

First Danish Translation. Ballad Measures.</p>


<h5>Grundtvig.</h5>

<p>Nicolas Frederic Severin Grundtvig (1783&ndash;1872) was especially
noted as a student of Old Germanic literature. He began his career in
1806 by his studies on the <i>Edda</i>. This was followed by a book on
Northern Mythology (1810), and by various creative works in verse and
prose, the subjects of which were usually drawn from old Danish history.
An account of his labors on the <i>Beowulf</i> will be found in the
following section. His interest in Old English literature continued
through his long life, and he was well and favorably known among the
scholars of his day.</p>


<h5>Circumstances of Publication.</h5>

<p>In <i>Beowulfs Beorh</i> (Copenhagen, 1861), Grundtvig tells the
story of his early translation of the poem. He had always had a
passionate interest in Danish antiquities, and was much excited upon the
appearance of Thorkelin’s text<a class = "tag" name = "tag_grundtvig2"
id = "tag_grundtvig2" href = "#note_grundtvig2">2</a>. At that time,
however, he knew no Old English,
<span class = "pagenum">23</span>
and his friend Rask, the famous scholar in Germanic philology, being
absent from Denmark, he resolved to do what he could with the poem
himself. He began by committing the entire poem to memory. In this way
he detected many of the outlines which had been obscured by Thorkelin.
The results of this study he published in the <i>Copenhagen
Sketch-Book</i> (<i>Kjøbenhavns Skilderie</i>), 1815. When Thorkelin saw
the studies he was furious, and pronounced the discoveries mere
fabrications.</p>

<p>But Rask, upon his return, thought differently, and proposed to
Grundtvig that they edit the poem together. They began the work, but
when they reached line 925 the edition was interrupted by Rask’s journey
into Russia and Asia. With the help of Rask’s <i>Anglo-Saxon Grammar</i>
(Stockholm, 1817), Grundtvig proceeded with his translation. By the
munificence of Bülow, who had also given assistance to Thorkelin,
Grundtvig was relieved of the expense of publication.</p>


<h5>Progress of the Interpretation of the Poem.</h5>

<p>Grundtvig was the first to understand the story of <i>Beowulf</i>.
With no other materials than Thorkelin’s edition of the text and his own
knowledge of Germanic mythology, he discovered the sea-burial of King
Scyld, the swimming-match, and the Finn episode. He identified Breca,
Hnæf, Hengest, King Hrethel, and other characters whose names Thorkelin
had filched from them.</p>


<h5>Text Used.</h5>

<p>Rask borrowed the original transcripts which Thorkelin had brought
from the British Museum, and copied and corrected them. This was the
basis of Grundtvig’s translation.</p>


<span class = "pagenum">24</span>
<h5>Differences between the First and Second Editions.</h5>

<p>The principal difference is in the introduction; but of the nature
and extent of changes in the second edition I can give no notion. All my
information respecting the first volume is derived from transcripts of
certain parts of it sent me from the British Museum. These copies do not
reveal any differences between the two translations.</p>


<h5><a name = "trans_grundtvig_aim" id = "trans_grundtvig_aim">
Aim of the Volume, and Nature of the Translation.</a></h5>

<p>We begin by quoting the author’s words:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
‘I have studied the poem as if I were going to translate it word for
word&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but I will not and have not translated it in
that way, and I will venture to maintain that my translation is a
faithful one, historically faithful, inasmuch as I have never wilfully
altered or interpolated anything, and poetically faithful inasmuch as I
have tried with all my might vividly to express what I saw in the
poem.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Whoever understands both languages and
possesses a poetical sense will see what I mean, and whoever is
deficient in knowledge or sense, or both, may stick to his own view, if
he will only let me stick to mine, which may be weak enough, but is not
so utterly devoid of style and poetry as little pettifoggers in the
intellectual world maintain because they can see very well that my
method is not theirs. “I&nbsp;have,” said Cicero, “translated
Demosthenes, not as a grammarian but as an orator, and therefore have
striven not so much to convince as to persuade my readers of the truth
of his words”: methinks I need no other defence as regards connoisseurs
and just judges, and if I am much mistaken in this opinion, then my work
is absolutely indefensible<a class = "tag" name = "tag_grundtvig3" id =
"tag_grundtvig3" href = "#note_grundtvig3">3</a>.’ &mdash;Pages xxxiv,
xxxv.
</blockquote>

<p>In the introduction to his text of 1861, Grundtvig speaks of his
theory of translation, saying that he gave, as it were, new clothes, new
money, and new language to the poor old Seven Sleepers, so that they
could associate freely with moderns. He believed that it was necessary
to put the poem into a form that would seem natural and
<span class = "pagenum">25</span>
attractive to the readers of the day. In so doing he departed from the
letter of the law, and rewrote the poem according to his own ideas.</p>

<p>In the second edition the author states that he hopes the poem will
prove acceptable as a reading-book for schools. Its value as a text-book
in patriotism is also alluded&nbsp;to.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">27</span>
<h5>Criticism of the Translation.</h5>

<p>The poem departs so far from the text of <i>Beowulf</i> that any
discussion of its accuracy would be out of place. As has been shown by
the section on the nature of the translation, the author had no
intention of being true to the letter of the text. Grundtvig’s
scholarship has been discussed above.</p>

<p>The translation may properly be called nothing more than a
paraphrase. Whole sentences are introduced that have no connection with
the original text. Throughout the translation is evident the robust, but
not always agreeable, personality of the translator. In his preface<a
class = "tag" name = "tag_grundtvig5" id = "tag_grundtvig5" href =
"#note_grundtvig5">5</a> Grundtvig remarked that he put nothing into his
poem that was not historically and poetically true to the original. The
statement can only be regarded as an unfortunate exaggeration.
Grundtvig’s style cannot be called even a faint reflection of the
<i>Beowulf</i> style. He has popularized the story, and he has cheapened
it. There is no warrant in the original for the coarse invective of the
extract that has just been cited. In the Old English, Hunferth taunts
Beowulf, but he never forgets that his rival is ‘doughty in battle’
(l.&nbsp;526). Beowulf is always worthy of his respect. In Grundtvig,
the taunting degenerates into a scurrilous tirade. Hunferth calls
Beowulf a ‘mudscow’; Breca and Beowulf swim like two ‘dead herrings.’ In
like manner the character of Hunferth is cheapened. In <i>Beowulf</i> he
is a jealous courtier, but he is always heroic. In Grundtvig he is
merely a contemptible braggart, ‘with his nose high in air,’ who will
not allow himself to be ‘thrown to the rubbish heap.’</p>

<p>The same false manner is retained throughout the poem. In many places
it reads well&mdash;it is often an excellent
<span class = "pagenum">28</span>
story. But it can lay no claim to historic or poetic fidelity to the
<i>Beowulf</i>.</p>


<h5>Reception of the Book.</h5>

<p>The book fell dead from the press. Grundtvig himself tells us that it
was hardly read outside his own house<a class = "tag" name =
"tag_grundtvig6" id = "tag_grundtvig6" href = "#note_grundtvig6">6</a>.
Thirty years later he learned that the book had never reached the Royal
Library at Stockholm. A&nbsp;copy made its way to the British Museum,
but it was the one which Grundtvig himself carried thither in 1829. This
was doubtless the copy that was read and criticized by Thorpe and
Wackerbarth. Both of these scholars spoke of its extreme freedom, but
commended its readableness.</p>

class = "tag" name = "tag_conybeare2" id = "tag_conybeare2" href =
"#note_conybeare2">2</a> that the <i>Beowulf</i> was finished in
October, 1820. But the book did not appear until two years after the
author’s death, and the material which it contains is of a slightly
earlier date than the title-page would seem to indicate&mdash;e.g. the
volume really antedates the third edition of Turner’s History discussed
above<a class = "tag" name = "tag_conybeare3" id = "tag_conybeare3" href
= "#note_conybeare3">3</a>.</p>


<h5>Conybeare, and the Progress of the Interpretation of the Poem.</h5>

<p>Conybeare did not edit the entire poem, and apparently never had any
intention of so doing. The selections which he translates are based on
Thorkelin’s text. He revises this text, however, in making his
translations, and even incorporates a collation of Thorkelin’s text with
the MS. (pp. 137&ndash;55). This collation, though not complete or
accurate, was serviceable, and kept Conybeare from falling into some of
the errors that the Icelander had made. He distinguished by an asterisk
the MS. readings which were of material importance in giving the sense
of a passage, and, in fact, constructed for himself a text that was
practically new.</p>

<blockquote>
‘The text has been throughout carefully collated with the original
Manuscript, and the translation of Thorkelin revised with all the
diligence of which the editor is capable.’ &mdash;Page&nbsp;32.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
‘Any attempt to restore the metre, and to correct the version
throughout, would have exceeded the bounds, and involved much discussion
foreign to the purpose of the present work. This must be left to the
labours of the Saxon scholar. It is evident, however, that without a
more correct text than that of Thorkelin, those labours must be
hopeless. The wish of supplying that deficiency, may perhaps
<span class = "pagenum">30</span>
apologize for the occupying, by this Collation, so large a space of a
work strictly dedicated to other purposes.’ &mdash;Page 137, footnote.
</blockquote>

<p>How much Conybeare improved the text may be seen by comparing his
text and Latin translation with those of Thorkelin. The first six lines
of the Prolog follow:&mdash;</p>

</table>

<p>It will be seen that in these lines Conybeare has at almost every
point the advantage over Thorkelin, and is indeed very nearly in accord
with modern texts and translations. But the poem yet awaited a complete
understanding, for Conybeare could say: ‘The Introduction is occupied by
the praises of Scefing&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and of his son and successor
Beowulf. The embarkation of the former on a piratical expedition is then
detailed at some length. In this expedition (if I rightly understand the
text) himself and his companions were taken or lost at sea’
(p.&nbsp;35). And, in general, he misses the same points of the story as
Thorkelin, although he craftily refrains from translating the obscurer
passages.</p>

<p>Conybeare apparently knew nothing of the critical work of Grundtvig.
This is not surprising when we remember that <i>Kjøbenhavns
Skilderie</i> was probably not known outside
<span class = "pagenum">31</span>
of Denmark<a class = "tag" name = "tag_conybeare4" id = "tag_conybeare4"
href = "#note_conybeare4">4</a>. Moreover, it is to be remembered that
Conybeare’s extracts from the <i>Beowulf</i> are not really later than
Grundtvig’s translation, since they were made in the same year, 1820<a
class = "tag" name = "tag_conybeare5" id = "tag_conybeare5" href =
"#note_conybeare5">5</a>.</p>


<h5>Aim of the Volume, and Nature of the Translations.</h5>

<p>From the words quoted above with respect to the collation, it will be
seen that Conybeare in no way regarded his book as a contribution to
Beowulf scholarship. As professor at Oxford, he attempted a literary
presentation of the most beautiful parts of the old poetry. His extracts
are, in general, nothing more than free paraphrases. Wishing to
popularize the <i>Beowulf</i>, he used as a medium of translation a
peculiarly stilted kind of blank verse. He dressed the poem out in
elegant phrases in order to hide the barrenness of the original.
Manifestly he feared the roughness, the remoteness of the poem in its
natural state. He feared to offend a nation of readers reveling in the
medievalism of Scott and Byron. A&nbsp;literal Latin translation was
inserted to appease the scholar.</p>

<h5>Criticism of the Translations.</h5>

<p>The English version is scarcely more than a paraphrase, as may easily
be seen by comparing it with the literal translation into Latin. But
even as a paraphrase it is unsatisfactory. By way of general criticism
it may be said that, while it attains a kind of dignity, it is not the
dignity of <i>Beowulf</i>, for it is self-conscious. Like <i>Beowulf</i>
it is elaborate, but it is the elaboration of art rather than of
feeling. Moreover, it is freighted with Miltonic phrase, and constantly
suggests the Miltonic movement. The trick of verse in line 3 is quite
too exquisite for <i>Beowulf</i>. The whole piece has a straining after
pomp and majesty that is utterly foreign to the simple, often baldly
simple, ideas and phrases of the original. Nearly every adjective is
supplied by the translator: in Old English the ‘sword’ is ‘bloody,’ in
Conybeare the ‘gallant sword drops fast a gory dew’; the cave becomes a
mansion; the ‘floor’ is ‘dust’&mdash;dust in an ocean
cave!&mdash;‘heaven’s candle’ becomes ‘heaven’s glorious torch.’ The
poem is tricked out almost beyond recognition. Beowulf assumes the
‘grand manner,’ and paces ‘the Grendel’s hold’ like one of the strutting
emperors of Dryden’s elaborate drama.</p>

<h5>The 1833 Volume.</h5>

<p>A sufficient account of this volume is given by Professor Earle, who
says of&nbsp;it:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
‘The text was an improvement on Thorkelin, but still very
faulty;&mdash;to say nothing of inaccuracies from want of proper
oversight as the sheets were passing through the press. The Glossary,
though short, was a valuable acquisition&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Of this
edition only 100 copies were printed;&mdash;and it was a happy
limitation, as it left room for a new edition as early as 1835, in which
the text was edited with far greater care. All the rest remained as
before, and the Preface was reprinted word for word.’ &mdash;<i>Deeds of
Beowulf</i>, pp. xix,&nbsp;xx.
</blockquote>


<h5>The Text of 1835. Kemble’s Scholarship.</h5>

<p>But whatever may be said of the text of 1833, there is nothing but
praise for the edition of 1835. In this book
<span class = "pagenum">34</span>
the poem first had the advantage of a modern scholarly treatment, and
for the first time the text of the MS. was correctly transcribed. It
received its first punctuation. For the first time it was properly
divided into half-lines, with attention to alliteration. The text was
freely emended, but the suggested readings were placed in the footnotes,
in order not to impair the value of the text as a reproduction of the
MS. The necessity for this was made evident by Kemble
himself:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
‘But while he makes the necessary corrections, no man is justified in
withholding the original readings: for although the laws of a language,
ascertained by wide and careful examination of all the cognate tongues,
of the hidden springs and ground-principles upon which they rest in
common, are like the laws of the Medes and Persians and alter not, yet
the very errors of the old writer are valuable, and serve sometimes as
guides and clues to the inner being and spiritual tendencies of the
language itself. The reader will moreover be spared that, to some
people, heart-burning necessity of taking his editor’s qualifications
too much for granted, if side by side he is allowed to judge of the
traditional error, and the proposed correction. I&nbsp;have endeavoured
to accomplish this end by printing the text, letter for letter, as I
found it.’ &mdash;Preface, pp. xxiv&nbsp;ff.
</blockquote>

<p>With this wholesome respect for the tradition of the MS., it is not
strange that Kemble’s carefully chosen emendations should stand to-day
as of high critical value, and that many of them are retained in modern
editions of the text<a class = "tag" name = "tag_kemble1" id =
"tag_kemble1" href = "#note_kemble1">1</a>. When we compare Kemble’s
book with Thorkelin’s, the advance is seen to be little less than
astonishing. Thorkelin’s emendations were worse than useless.</p>

<p>Kemble had a full acquaintance with the new science of comparative
philology which was developing in Germany under Jakob Grimm. He had
corresponded, and later studied, with Grimm, and, according to William
Hunt, was the ‘recognised exponent’ of his investigations<a class =
"tag" name = "tag_kemble2" id = "tag_kemble2" href =
"#note_kemble2">2</a>. It is to
<span class = "pagenum">35</span>
Grimm that Kemble dedicates his volumes, and to him that he repeatedly
acknowledges his indebtedness. Thus Kemble brought to the study of the
poem not only a knowledge of the Old English poetry and prose, but
acquaintance with Old Norse, Gothic, Old High German, and Old Saxon. It
may sufficiently illustrate his scholarly method to instance examples of
his treatment of the unique words in <i>Beowulf</i>. Take, e.g., the
word <i>hose</i> in line 924. This word does not appear elsewhere in Old
English; it does not appear in Lye’s <i>Dictionary</i>, the only
dictionary that was at Kemble’s disposal. Upon this word Kemble brought
to bear his knowledge of the Germanic tongues, and by citing Goth.
<i>hansa</i>, OHG. <i>hansa</i>, &amp;c., derived the meaning
<i>turma</i>&mdash;a&nbsp;process in which he is supported by a modern
authority like Kluge. The study of compounds also first began with
Kemble. He collected and compared the compounds in <i>heaðo.</i>. Thus
he laid the foundation of all modern studies on the Old English
compound.</p>


<h5>Further Critical Material Afforded by the Volume of 1837.</h5>

<p>In the 1835 volume twenty-three words were illustrated in the above
way. But it remained for the 1837 volume to present a complete glossary
of the poem, containing also important poetic words not in
<i>Beowulf</i>. By reason of its completeness and comparative work, it
remained the standard commentary on the Old English poetic vocabulary
until the appearance of Grein’s <i>Sprachschatz</i><a class = "tag" name
= "tag_kemble3" id = "tag_kemble3" href = "#note_kemble3">3</a>.</p>


<h5>Aim of Kemble’s Translation.</h5>

<p>Like his edition of the text, Kemble’s translation is quite
independent of any preceding book; like his edition of the text, its aim
was faithfulness to the original. He adheres scrupulously to the text,
save where the original
<span class = "pagenum">36</span>
is unintelligible. The translation was designed to be used together with
the glossary as a part of the apparatus for interpreting the poem. He
therefore made it strictly literal.</p>

<blockquote>
‘The translation is a literal one; I was bound to give, word for word,
the original in all its roughness: I&nbsp;might have made it smoother,
but I purposely avoided doing so, because had the Saxon poet thought as
we think, and expressed his thoughts as we express our thoughts,
I&nbsp;might have spared myself the trouble of editing or translating
his poem. A&nbsp;few transpositions of words, &amp;c. caused principally
by the want of inflections in New English (since we have now little more
than their position by which to express the relations of words to one
another) are all that I have allowed myself, and where I have inserted
words I have generally printed them in italics.’ &mdash;

ever have beneath the skies, more reputation with the world than he

</blockquote>


<h5>Criticism of the Translation.</h5>

<p>Kemble’s scholarship enabled him to get a full understanding of the
poem, and thus to make the first really adequate translation of
<i>Beowulf</i>. He was the first to recognize the significance of
kenning, metaphor, and compound. Thus his work is to be commended
chiefly because of its faithfulness. All preceding studies had been
wofully inaccurate<a class = "tag" name = "tag_kemble7" id =
"tag_kemble7" href = "#note_kemble7">7</a>. Kemble’s editions became at
once the authoritative commentary on the text, and held this position
until the appearance of Grein’s <i>Bibliothek</i> (1857). In this latter
book, Kemble’s text was the principal authority used in correcting the
work of Thorpe<a class = "tag" name = "tag_kemble8" id = "tag_kemble8"
href = "#note_kemble8">8</a>. In spite of the fact that this is a
literal translation, it sometimes attains strength and beauty by reason
of its very simplicity.</p>

First German Translation. Imitative measures.</p>


<h5>Ettmüller.</h5>

<p>Ernst Moritz Ludwig Ettmüller (1802&ndash;77), at the time of the
publication of this book, was professor of the German
<span class = "pagenum">38</span>
language and literature in the Gymnasium at Zürich. He had already
appeared as a translator with a work entitled <i>Lieder der Edda von den
Nibelungen</i>. Later he edited selections from the <i>Beowulf</i> in
his <i>Engla and Seaxna Scôpas and Bôceras</i> (1850). This text
incorporated many new readings. Ettmüller was the first to question the
unity of the <i>Beowulf</i>, and sketched a theory of interpolations
which has since been developed by Müllenhoff. The first announcement of
these views is found in the introduction to this translation.</p>


<h5>Theory of Translation.</h5>

<p>Ettmüller gives full expression to his theories and aims:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
‘Vor Allem habe ich so wörtlich als möglich übersetzt, da Treue das
erste Erforderniss einer guten Übersetzung ist. Dann aber war mein
Augenmerk vorzüglich auf Wohlklang und Verständlichkeit gerichtet.
Letztere werden bei Übersetzungen dieser Art nur zu oft vernachlässigt,
da manche der Ansicht sind, ihre Arbeit sei um so besser, je treuer sie
die äussere Form des Originals in allen Einzelheiten wiedergebe. Aber
dieweil diese so mühsam an der Schale knacken, entschlüpft ihnen nicht
selten der Kern. Mein Bestreben war demnach keineswegs, z.B. jeden Vers
ängstlich dem Originale nachzubilden, so dass die genaueste
Übereinstimmung zwischen der Silbenzahl und den Hebungen oder gar dem
Klange der Verse Statt fände. Das wäre ohnehin, ohne der deutschen
Sprache die schreiendste Gewalt anzuthun, unmöglich gewesen. Ich habe
vielmehr darnach mit Sorgfalt gestrebt, die Versbildung des
angelsächsischen Gedichtes mir in allen ihren Erscheinungen klar zu
machen, und dann frei nach dem <ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘gewonnen’">gewonnenen</ins> Schema gearbeitet. Daher kann ich
versichern, dass man für jeden Vers meiner Übersetzung gewiss ein
angelsächsisches Vorbild findet, wenn auch nicht grade jedesmal die
Verse einander decken. Dass dabei übrigens der höheren Rhythmik, d.h.
dem ästhetisch richtigen Verhältnisse des Ausdruckes zu dem
Ausgedrückten oder, mit Klopstock zu reden, des Zeitausdruckes oder
Tonverhaltes (der Bewegung) zu dem Gedanken, überall die grösste
Sorgfalt zugewendet ward, das braucht, dünkt mich, keiner besondern
Versicherung; dies aber kann erreicht werden auch ohne knechtische
Nachbildung des Originals.’ &mdash;Page&nbsp;59.

<h5>Text, and Indebtedness to Preceding Scholars.</h5>

name = "tag_ettmuller1" id = "tag_ettmuller1" href =
"#note_ettmuller1">1</a>, to which the introduction and notes are also
indebted.</p>

<p>Like Kemble, Ettmüller was a close student of the works of Jakob
Grimm, and his interpretation of obscure lines (especially passages
relating to Germanic antiquities) is largely due to the study of such
works as the <i>Deutsche Mythologie</i> (1833), the <i>Deutsche
Rechtsalterthümer</i> (1828), and the <i>Deutsche Sagen</i>
(1816&ndash;8). Cf. lines 458, 484.</p>

<h5>Criticism of the Translation.</h5>

<p>In his translation Ettmüller followed in the steps of Kemble<a class
= "tag" name = "tag_ettmuller2" id = "tag_ettmuller2" href =
"#note_ettmuller2">2</a>, but he was not slavishly dependent upon him.
At times he disagrees with the English scholar (cp. e.g., ll. 468, 522,
1331), and offers a translation of the passage omitted by him,
3069&ndash;74. In general, the translation is strictly literal, and
follows the original almost line for line.</p>

<p>It was probably well for Ettmüller that he made his translation thus
literal. In the history of a foreign-language study there is a period
when it is best that a translation should be strictly literal, for such
a work is bound to be called into service as a part of the critical
apparatus for the interpretation of the tongue. If the early translation
is not thus literal, it is sure to be superseded later by the more
faithful rendering, as Schaldemose’s superseded Grundtvig’s in Denmark<a
class = "tag" name = "tag_ettmuller3" id = "tag_ettmuller3" href =
"#note_ettmuller3">3</a>. It is not until criticism and scholarship have
done their strictly interpretative work that a translation is safe in
attempting to render the spirit rather than the letter of the original.
The reason for this is evident: no real appreciation of the spirit is
possible until scholarship has provided the means for
discovering&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>By the publication of this volume, therefore, Ettmüller did for
German scholarship what Kemble had done for English and Schaldemose was
to do for Danish scholarship. Yet he might with propriety have made his
work more simple. His translation is disfigured by numerous strange
word-combinations which he often transcribed literally from the
original, e.g. <i>beadu-runen</i> in the third line of the extract. It
is safe to say that none but a scholar in Old English would be able to
understand this word&mdash;if, indeed, we may call it a word. The text
is full of such forms. The author
<span class = "pagenum">41</span>
is obliged to append notes explaining his own translation! He apparently
forgets that it is his business as translator to render the difficult
words as well as the simple ones. In Ettmüller’s case it was especially
unfortunate, because it gave others an opportunity to come forward later
with simpler, and hence more useful, translations.</p>


<h5>Reception of the Translation.</h5>

<p>The book had no extraordinary success. A&nbsp;reprint was never
called for, and was perhaps hardly to be expected, considering the
existence of Kemble’s volumes. Moreover, the translation was not
accompanied by an edition of the text. Grein<a class = "tag" name =
"tag_ettmuller4" id = "tag_ettmuller4" href = "#note_ettmuller4">4</a>,
the next German scholar, took his inspiration from Kemble<a class =
"tag" name = "tag_ettmuller5" id = "tag_ettmuller5" href =

<h5>Nature of the Volume, and Indebtedness to Previous Scholars.</h5>

<p>In this book the Old English text and the Danish translation were
printed in parallel columns. The text, which was taken literally from
Kemble<a class = "tag" name = "tag_schaldemose1" id = "tag_schaldemose1"
href = "#note_schaldemose1">1</a>, need not detain us here. No mention
is made of the work of Leo<a class = "tag" name = "tag_schaldemose2" id
= "tag_schaldemose2" href = "#note_schaldemose2">2</a>, Ettmüller<a
class = "tag" name = "tag_schaldemose3" id = "tag_schaldemose3" href =
"#note_schaldemose3">3</a>, or of the 1837 volume of Kemble, although
<span class = "pagenum">42</span>
the influence of the latter is evident throughout the book, as will be
shown below. The notes are drawn largely from the works of preceding
scholars, and in these the author makes an occasional acknowledgement of
indebtedness.</p>

<p>The translation is literal. Grundtvig’s translation<a class = "tag"
name = "tag_schaldemose4" id = "tag_schaldemose4" href =
"#note_schaldemose4">4</a> had been so paraphrastic as often to obscure
the sense, and always the spirit, of the original. Schaldemose had the
advantage of presenting the most modern text side by side with the
translation. Thus the book became a valuable <i>apparatus criticus</i>
for the Danish student.</p>


<h5>Schaldemose.</h5>

<p>The life of Frederik Schaldemose (1782&ndash;1853) was by no means
the quiet, retired life of the student. He had, it is true, been
professor at the school of Nykjøbing from 1816 to 1825, and later
devoted himself to literary work; but a large part of his life had been
spent in military service, in which he had had many exciting adventures
by land and sea. After leaving his professorship he again entered
military service. Later, he devoted his time alternately to literary and
commercial work.</p>

<p>His interest in <i>Beowulf</i> seems to have been, like that of
Thorkelin<a class = "tag" name = "tag_schaldemose5" id =
"tag_schaldemose5" href = "#note_schaldemose5">5</a>, primarily the
interest of the Danish antiquary. In 1846 he had published a collection
of Heroic Danish Songs, ancient and modern. It was doubtless a desire to
add to this collection that led him to undertake an edition of the
<i>Beowulf</i>.</p>

<p>It was hardly to be expected that a man whose life had been so
unsettled could materially advance the interpretation of Old English
poetry.</p>

<h5>Criticism of the Text and Translation.</h5>

<p>There are two good things to be said of this volume: it contains a
literal translation, and it is a literal translation from Kemble’s text.
Being so, it could not be without merit. There was need of a literal
translation in Denmark. Grundtvig’s version certainly did not fulfil the
letter of the law, and Thorkelin’s had long since been forgotten.</p>

<p>Schaldemose’s dependence upon the translation of Kemble is very
evident. In general, the Danish translator is stopped by the same
passages that defy the English translator, e.g. the passage which Kemble
failed to interpret at line 3075 was duly and loyally omitted by
Schaldemose.</p>

<p>I can find no evidence for the reiterated<a class = "tag" name =
"tag_schaldemose6" id = "tag_schaldemose6" href =
"#note_schaldemose6">6</a> statement that Schaldemose is throughout his
translation slavishly indebted to Ettmüller. Certain it is that he
avoided those peculiar forms of Ettmüller’s translation which are
nothing more than a transliteration from the Old English.</p>


<h5>Reception of the Volume.</h5>

<p>It is a tribute to the Danish interest in Beowulf that Schaldemose’s
volume soon passed into a second edition.
<span class = "pagenum">45</span>
But it was not of a character to arouse the interest of scholars in
other countries. Thorpe, the next editor of the poem, had never
seen&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>The translation, being strictly literal, naturally commanded very
little attention even in Denmark; while it was utterly without interest
for readers and students in other countries.</p>

WACKERBARTH’S TRANSLATION</a></h3>

<p>Beowulf, an epic poem translated from the Anglo-Saxon into English
verse, by A. Diedrich Wackerbarth, A.B., Professor of Anglo-Saxon at the
College of our Ladye of Oscott. London: William Pickering, 1849.
8<sup>o</sup>, pp. xlvi, 159.</p>

<p class = "space">
Second English Translation. Ballad Measures.</p>


<h5>Circumstances of Publication.</h5>

<p>In the introduction Wackerbarth gives a full account of the history
of the book:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
‘With respect to the Work now presented to the Public, shortly after the
putting forth of Mr. Kemble’s Edition of the Anglo-Saxon Text in 1833 I
formed the Design of translating it, and early in 1837 I commenced the
Work. Mr. Kemble’s second Volume had not then appeared, and I proceeded
but slowly, on account of the Difficulty of the Work, and the utter
Inadequacy of any then existing Dictionary. I&nbsp;still however wrought
my Way onward, under the Notion that even if I should not think my Book,
when finished, fit for Publication, yet that the MS. would form an
amusing Tale for my little Nephews and Nieces, and so I went through
about a Quarter of the Poem when Illness put an entire stop to my
Progress. Afterwards, though the Appearance of Mr. Kemble’s additional
Volume, containing the Prose
<span class = "pagenum">46</span>
Version, Glossary, &amp;c. had rendered the remainder of my Task
comparatively easy, other Matters required my Attention, and the MS. lay
untouched until 1842, between which Time and the present it has been
from Time to Time added to and at length completed, and the whole
carefully revised, much being cancelled and retranslated.’
&mdash;Introduction, p.&nbsp;viii.
</blockquote>


<h5>Indebtedness to preceding Scholars.</h5>

<blockquote>
‘In my Version I have scrupulously adhered to the text of Mr. Kemble,
adopting in almost every Instance his Emendations.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
My thanks are due to Mr. Kemble&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to the Rev. Dr.
Bosworth&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. who have&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. kindly
answered my Inquiries relative to various Matters connected with the
poem.’ &mdash;Pages viii, xiv.
</blockquote>


<h5>Style and Diction.</h5>

<blockquote>
‘I have throughout endeavoured to render the Sense and the Words of my
Author as closely as the English Language and the Restraints of Metre
would allow, and for this Purpose I have not shrunken either from
sacrificing Elegance to Faithfulness (for no Translator is at liberty to
misrepresent his Author and make an old Saxon Bard speak the Language of
a modern Petit Maître) or from uniting English Words to express
important Anglo-Saxon compounds.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Some may ask why I
have not preserved the Anglo-Saxon alliterative Metre. My Reason is that
I do not think the Taste of the English People would at present bear it.
I&nbsp;wish to get my book read, that my Countrymen may become generally
acquainted with the Epic of our Ancestors wherewith they have been
generally unacquainted, and for this purpose it was necessary to adopt a
Metre suited to the Language; whereas the alliterative Metre, heavy even
in German, a&nbsp;Language much more fitted for it than ours, would in
English be so heavy that few would be found to labour through a Poem of
even half the Length of the Beówulf’s lay when presented in so
unattractive a Garb.’ &mdash;Pages ix,&nbsp;x.

<h5>Criticism of the Translation.</h5>

<p>Wackerbarth’s translation is not to be considered as a rival of
Kemble’s<a class = "tag" name = "tag_wackerbarth1" id =
"tag_wackerbarth1" href = "#note_wackerbarth1">1</a>&mdash;the author
did not wish it to be
<span class = "pagenum">48</span>
so considered. Kemble addressed the world of scholars; Wackerbarth the
world of readers. Wackerbarth rather resembles Conybeare<a class = "tag"
name = "tag_wackerbarth2" id = "tag_wackerbarth2" href =
"#note_wackerbarth2">2</a> in trying to reproduce the <i>spirit</i> of
the poem, and make his book appeal to a popular audience. Wackerbarth
had the advantage of basing his translation on the accurate and
scholarly version of Kemble; yet Conybeare and Wackerbarth were equally
unsuccessful in catching the spirit of the original. The reason for
their failure is primarily in the media which they chose. It would seem
that if there were a measure less suited to the Beowulf style than the
Miltonic blank verse used by Conybeare, it would be the ballad measures
used by Wackerbarth. The movement of the ballad is easy, rapid, and
garrulous. Now, if there are three qualities of which the <i>Beowulf</i>
is not possessed, they are ease, rapidity, and garrulity. Not only does
the poet avoid superfluous words&mdash;the ballad never does&mdash;but
he frequently does not use words enough. His meaning is thus often vague
and nebulous, or harsh and knotted. Nor can the poem properly be called
rapid. It is often hurried, and more often insufficient in detail, but
it never has sustained rapidity. The kenning alone is hostile to
rapidity. The poet lingers lovingly over his thought as if loath to
leave it; he repeats, amplifies. The description of Grendel’s approach
to Heorot is given three times within twenty lines.</p>

<p>Now these features which have just been described Wackerbarth’s
ballad lines are eminently unfitted to transmit. But there is still
another reason for shunning them. They are almost continuously
suggestive of Scott. Of all men else the translator of <i>Beowulf</i>
should avoid Scott. Scott’s medievalism is hundreds of years and miles
away from the medievalism of <i>Beowulf</i>. His is the self-conscious,
dramatic, gorgeous age of
<span class = "pagenum">49</span>
chivalry, of knight and lady, of pomp and pride. <i>Beowulf</i> is
simple to bareness.</p>

<p>It is in such strong picturesque passages as the swimming-match that
Wackerbarth’s style is worst. There is a plethora of adjectives,
scarcely one of which is found in the original; but they are of no
avail&mdash;they are too commonplace to render the strength and raciness
of the original words. There is too much ballad padding&mdash;‘then he
cry’d,’ ‘at last,’ ‘well and faithfully,’ ‘onslaught dire, and deadly
fight.’ Hunferth prattles. The heroic atmosphere is gone.</p>

<p>In passages calling for calmness, solemnity, or elevation of
thought&mdash;and there are many such&mdash;the easy flow of a verse
monotonous and trivial effectually destroys the beauty of the lines.</p>

<p>But in spite of its very evident limitations, Wackerbarth’s
translation was a move in the right direction. His aim, in his own
words, was to ‘get his book read,’ and he was wise in choosing a medium
that would be popular, even if it were not satisfactory to the scholar.
It was better to have <i>Beowulf</i> according to Wackerbarth than no
<i>Beowulf</i> at all.</p>

<h5>Author’s Prefatory Remarks.</h5>

<blockquote>
‘Twenty-four years have passed since, while residing in Denmark,
I&nbsp;first entertained the design of one day producing an edition of
Beowulf; and it was in prosecution of that design that, immediately on
my arrival in England in 1830, I&nbsp;carefully collated the text of
Thorkelin’s edition with the Cottonian manuscript. Fortunately, no
doubt, for the work, a&nbsp;series of cares, together with other
literary engagements, intervened and arrested my progress. I&nbsp;had,
in fact, abandoned every thought of ever resuming the task: it was
therefore with no slight pleasure that I hailed the appearance of Mr.
Kemble’s first edition of the text of Beowulf in
1833.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
‘Copies of Mr. Kemble’s editions having for some time past been of rare
occurrence, I&nbsp;resolved on resuming my suspended labour, and, as far
as I was able, supplying a want felt by many an Anglo-Saxon student both
at home and abroad.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
‘My first impulse was to print the text of the poem as it appears in the
manuscript, with a literal translation in parallel columns, placing all
conjectural emendations at the foot of each page; but, on comparing the
text with the version in this juxta-position, so numerous and so
enormous and puerile did the blunders of the copyist appear, and,
consequently, so great the discrepance between the text and the
translation, that I found myself compelled to admit into the text the
greater number of the conjectural emendations, consigning to the foot of
the page the corresponding readings of the manuscript. In every case
which I thought might by others be considered questionable, I&nbsp;have
followed the more usual course, of retaining in the text the reading of
the manuscript, and placing the proposed correction at
foot.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
‘Very shortly after I had collated it, the manuscript suffered still
further detriment.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
‘In forming this edition I resolved to proceed independently of the
version or views of every preceding editor.’ &mdash;Pages vii, viii,
xii, xiii.

<h5><a name = "trans_thorpe_text" id = "trans_thorpe_text">
Criticism of Thorpe’s Text.</a></h5>

<p>Considering the amount of time that had elapsed between this and the
edition of Kemble<a class = "tag" name = "tag_thorpe1" id =
"tag_thorpe1" href = "#note_thorpe1">1</a>, Thorpe can hardly be said to
have made a satisfactory advance. In some respects his edition is
actually inferior to Kemble’s. It is probable,
<span class = "pagenum">51</span>
for example, that the collation of which the author speaks in his
introduction was the one which he had made twenty years before, and
that, in taking up his work a second time, he did not trouble himself to
revise it. At any rate, the MS. did not receive from Thorpe that
respectful attention that it had had from Kemble. Thorpe was more clever
than the former scholar in deciphering faded lines of the MS., but he
was not always careful to indicate those letters which he actually found
there, and those he himself supplied from conjecture. Yet these readings
were often of sufficient importance to affect an entire passage, and
later scholarship has in many cases deciphered readings whose sense is
entirely different from Thorpe’s. Thus his edition presents striking
divergences from later texts, while no explanation of them is offered in
the footnotes. Not only does he frequently incorporate his own readings
in the text without noting the MS. forms, but he even makes mistakes in
the MS. forms which he does note. A&nbsp;collation of Thorpe’s text with
the MS. has revealed a carelessness which was all the more reprehensible
in that it came from a scholar who was thought to be well-nigh
infallible. A&nbsp;few examples of this carelessness are
given:&mdash;</p>

<p>These selections give a good basis for judging the merits and defects
of Thorpe’s edition. Thorpe is seen to have the advantage in deciphering
certain parts of the text, see e.g. lines 9, 11, 17. On the other hand,
Kemble is far more conscientious. Thus at line 13 Thorpe reads <i>ne</i>
as if it were found in the MS. It is not there, and Kemble is right in
inclosing the letters in parentheses. The same
<span class = "pagenum">53</span>
thing is true of <i>Fǽr</i> in line 19, and Gren<i>dl</i>es in line 14.
Thorpe’s emendations in lines 3 and 5 are an advance on Kemble, and are
still retained in the text. But Thorpe might have followed Kemble’s
punctuation in 18 and 19 to his advantage.</p>

<h5>Criticism of the Translation.</h5>

<p>This being a strictly literal translation, the reader is referred to
the sections on the text for a valuation and criticism. It is a question
whether there was need for another literal rendering in England at this
time. Kemble’s translation was not yet out of date, and with Thorpe’s
new glossary the student had a sufficient apparatus for the
interpretation of the poem.</p>

<p>Some German scholars have discovered that the short lines in which
Thorpe’s translation is couched are imitative of the Old English
measure. I&nbsp;am unable to agree with them. Probably any short-line
translation would <i>ipso facto</i> assume a choppiness not dissimilar
to the Old English, and probably plenty of lines could be discovered
which correspond well enough to the ‘five types,’ but the agreement
seems purely fortuitous. It is quite unlikely that Thorpe intended any
imitation.</p>

Second German Translation. Imitative Measures.</p>


<h5>Grein’s Preparation for Scholarly Work.</h5>

<p>Christian Wilhelm Michael Grein<a class = "tag" name = "tag_grein1"
id = "tag_grein1" href = "#note_grein1">1</a> (1825&ndash;77) was
eminently well fitted for the editing and translating of Old English
poetry. He possessed a natural aptitude for the study of Germanic
Philology, and had the advantage of studying with an excellent
professor, Franz Eduard Christoph Dietrich (1810&ndash;83), in the
University at Marburg. As early as 1854 he began his labors as a
translator of Old English poetry with a version of the <i>Phoenix</i>,
‘Der Vogel Phoenix: ein angelsächsisches Gedicht, stabreimend
übersetzt,’
<span class = "pagenum">56</span>
Rinteln, 1854. In the same year he printed a translation of the
<i>Heliand</i>.</p>

<p>In 1855 he assumed the position of Praktikant at the Kassel
Landesbibliothek. Here he was able to devote a large part of his
attention to the study of Old English, acquiring a familiarity with the
poetry of that tongue which it has seldom been the fortune of a scholar
to surpass. He formed the design of editing and translating the entire
body of Old English poetry and appending to it a complete glossary which
should not only give the meanings of the words, but instance every
occurrence of the word. This design he carried out between the years
1857 and 1864.</p>


<h5><a name = "trans_grein_texts" id = "trans_grein_texts">
Grein’s Texts.</a></h5>

<p>The text of <i>Beowulf</i> is found in Grein’s <i>Bibliothek der
angelsächsichen Poesie</i>, Erster Band, Göttingen, 1857, where it
occupies pp. 255&ndash;341. A&nbsp;second edition, several times
re-edited, is <i>Beovulf, nebst den Fragmenten Finnsburg und
Waldere</i>, Kassel und Göttingen, 1867.</p>

<p>Grein never saw the MS. of the poem<a class = "tag" name =
"tag_grein2" id = "tag_grein2" href = "#note_grein2">2</a>. He based his
text on a collation of all the preceding editions. This was unfortunate,
because, had Grein seen the MS., he would doubtless have hastened to
make a correct transcription of it. As it was, his edition necessarily
shares some of the faults of its predecessors, since the text had never
yet been accurately transcribed. A&nbsp;simple illustration of this
defect may be seen by examining line 2218 of the text, where Grein
reads,</p>

<p class = "verse">
<i>be fire, fyrena hyrde</i>,</p>

<p>following Thorpe<a class = "tag" name = "tag_grein3" id =
"tag_grein3" href = "#note_grein3">3</a>. As has been pointed out, this
is an impossible reading, and one for which there is no justification in
the MS. Thorpe, however, had presented it as the MS. reading, and Grein
could not but copy&nbsp;it.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">57</span>
<p>Like Kemble, Grein had a supreme respect for the readings of the MS.,
and he announced his intention of following this reading wherever
possible:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
‘Bei der Behandlung des Textes galt als erste Pflicht, handschriftliche
Lesarten, wo es nur immer möglich war, zu retten und namentlich auch
manche angezweifelte, den Lexicis fremde Wörter als wolbegründet
nachzuweisen: nur da, wo Verderbniss auf der Hand liegt, habe ich mir
mit der grössten Vorsicht Aenderungen erlaubt oder bereits von Andern
vorgeschlagene Aenderungen aufgenommen, wobei ich mich möglichst eng an
das handschriftlich gebotene anzuschliessen suchte.’ &mdash;Vorwort, iv.
(<i>Bibl.</i>).
</blockquote>

<p>This was wise. Since the days of Kemble, emendation had become
unnecessarily frequent. We have seen in what a light-hearted way Thorpe
spoke of the ‘blunders of the scribes,’ and how careless he was in the
preparation of his text. The dialect had not yet received proper
attention, and the copyists were blamed for errors that they never
made.</p>

<p>Grein was extremely clever in filling the lacunae of the MS., and his
conjectural emendations are frequently retained by later editors.</p>

<p>Still another improvement which he introduced was the full
punctuation of the text; this was superior to any that had preceded it.
In previous editions defective punctuation had obscured the sense of the
lines; here it was made a factor in their interpretation.</p>


<h5>Theory of Translation.</h5>

<p>Grein’s theory of translation is sufficiently expressed in the
Vorrede to the <i>Dichtungen</i>:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
‘Die Sammlung von metrischen Uebersetzungen angelsächsischer Dichtungen,
deren erster Band hiermit der Oeffentlichkeit übergeben wird, soll einen
doppelten Zweck erfüllen. Einerseits betrachte ich dieselben als eine
wesentliche Ergänzung, gleichsam als fortlaufenden Commentar zu meiner
gleichzeitig in demselben Verlag erscheinenden Textausgabe der
angelsächsischen Dichter, indem sie meine Interpretation
<span class = "pagenum">58</span>
der Originaltexte, worin ich oft von meinen Vorgängern abweiche, einfach
vor Augen legen. Andrerseits aber bezweckte ich dadurch die
Bekanntschaft mit den in vieler Beziehung so herrlichen dichterischen
Erzeugnissen des uns engverwandten englischen Volkes aus der Zeit vor
dem gewaltsamen Eindringen des romanischen Elements durch die
normannische Eroberung auch in weiteren Kreisen anzubahnen, was sie
sowol nach ihrem Inhalte als auch nach der poetischen Behandlung des
Stoffes gewiss in hohem Grade verdienen. Daher war ich eifrigst bemüht,
die Uebersetzung dem Original in möglichster Treue nach Inhalt, Ausdruck
und Form eng anzuschliessen: namentlich suchte ich, soweit es immer bei
dem heutigen Stande unserer Sprache thunlich war, auch den Rhythmus des
Originals nachzubilden, wobei es vor allem auf die Beibehaltung der
eigentümlichen Stellung der Stabreime ankam, ein Punkt, der bei der
Uebertragung alter Alliterationspoesien nur zu oft vernachlässigt wird.’
&mdash;Vorrede, iii.
</blockquote>


<h5>Differences between the two Editions.</h5>

<p>The second edition of the translation (see supra, <ins class =
"correction" title = "error for ‘p. 55’"><a href =
"#trans_grein">p.&nbsp;65</a></ins>) was edited from Grein’s
‘Handexemplar’ of the <i>Dichtungen</i> after his death by Professor
Wülker, who has also re-edited the text of the <i>Bibliothek</i>. The
differences are seldom more than verbal, and are largely in the early
parts of the poem. The second edition is, of course, superior.</p>

<h5>Criticism of the Translation.</h5>

<p>The translation is a literal line-for-line version. Its superiority
to its predecessors is, therefore, one with the superiority of the text
on which it is founded.</p>

<p>The translation became at once the standard commentary on
<i>Beowulf</i>, and this position it retained for many years. It is
still the standard literal translation in Germany, none of the later
versions having equaled it in point of accuracy.</p>

Karl Simrock. Stuttgart und Augsburg: J. G. Cotta’scher Verlag, 1859.
8<sup>o</sup>, pp. iv, 203.</p>

<p class = "space">
Third German Translation. Imitative Measures.</p>


<h5>Simrock.</h5>

<p>Dr. Karl Simrock (1802&ndash;1876) brought to the translation of
<i>Beowulf</i> the thorough knowledge of a scholar,
<span class = "pagenum">60</span>
the fine feeling and technique of a poet, and an enviable reputation as
a translator of Old German poetry. At the time when he made his
translation of <i>Beowulf</i>, he was Professor of Old German Literature
at Bonn, whither he had been called because of his contributions to the
study of Old German mythology. His title to remembrance rests, however,
on his metrical rendering of the <i>Nibelungenlied</i>, a&nbsp;work
which, in 1892, had passed into its fifty-second edition. As an original
poet, Simrock is remembered for his <i>Wieland der Schmied</i> (1835),
and <i>Gedichte</i> (1844).</p>


<h5>Object of the Translation.</h5>

<p>Simrock wished to do for <i>Beowulf</i> what he had done for the
<i>Nibelungenlied</i>, <i>Walther von der Vogelweide</i>, and <i>Der
arme Heinrich</i>. He objected to the too literal work of Ettmüller<a
class = "tag" name = "tag_simrock1" id = "tag_simrock1" href =
"#note_simrock1">1</a> and Grein<a class = "tag" name = "tag_simrock2"
id = "tag_simrock2" href = "#note_simrock2">2</a>, hoping in his own
work to make the poem readable and to dispense with a ‘note for every
third word’:</p>

<blockquote>
‘Geist und Stimmung einer fernen Heldenzeit anklingen zu lassen, und
doch dem Ausdruck die frische Farbe des Lebens zu verleihen.’
&mdash;Vorrede, iii.
</blockquote>

<p>In this ambition he was justified by his success as a translator of
Old German poetry.</p>


<h5>Nature of the Translation.</h5>

<p>The diction of the version is, on the whole, characterized by
simplicity and ease. Yet the author, like many another translator of Old
English, tries to give his style an archaic tinge by preserving the
compound forms characteristic of that language, such as Lustholz,
Aelgelage, Kampfrunen, a&nbsp;fault that Ettmüller had carried to
excess. These forms he sometimes used to the exclusion of simpler, or
even
<span class = "pagenum">61</span>
more literal, words. The nature of the German language, however, keeps
these from being as repulsive as they are in English, but they are
sufficiently strange to mystify and annoy the reader.</p>

<p>The feature of his translation for which Simrock was most concerned
was the measure:</p>

<blockquote>
‘Vor Allem aber den Wohllaut, der echter Poesie unzertrennlich verbunden
ist, das schien mir die erste Bedingung, damit der
Leser&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. den Sinn ahne und von der Schönheit des <ins
class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘Gedichtes’">Gedichts</ins>
ergriffen von Blatt zu Blatt getragen werde. Nur so glaubte ich eine
tausendjährige Kluft überbrücken und dieser mit Angeln und Sachsen
ausgewanderten Dichtung neues Heimatsrecht bei uns erwerben zu können.’
&mdash;Vorrede, iii,&nbsp;iv.
</blockquote>

<p>He also preserved alliteration, believing that a fondness for that
poetic adornment may be easily acquired, and that it is by no means
inconsistent with the genius of modern tongues.</p>


<h5>Relation of Translation and other Parts of the Book.</h5>

<p>The notes to the translation contain discussions of the episodes and
of the mythological personages of the poem. There is a discussion of the
poetic worth of <i>Beowulf</i>, and an argument for the German origin of
the poem. But the translation is the <i>raison d’être</i> of the volume,
and other parts are strictly subordinated to it. The Finnsburg fragment
is inserted at the end of section&nbsp;16. As the author does not wish
to disturb the order of <i>Beowulf</i>, he is obliged to place the poem
at the end of the Finnsburg episode (in <i>Beowulf</i>), a&nbsp;very
ill-chosen position, where it can only confuse the general reader more
than the obscure lines to which it is related. This practice of
inserting the Finnsburg fragment, lately revived by Hoffmann<a class =
"tag" name = "tag_simrock3" id = "tag_simrock3" href =
"#note_simrock3">3</a>, has been generally repudiated.</p>

<h5>Criticism of the Translation.</h5>

<p>Simrock’s translation is commendable for its faithfulness. It is,
moreover, a&nbsp;simple and readable version, though in
<span class = "pagenum">63</span>
these respects it is not equal to Heyne’s rendering which was to follow
it; but it was easily superior to Grein’s. Yet, in spite of this, the
book is not well known among German translations, and has never passed
into a second edition. This is surprising when we consider the success
of Simrock’s previous translations. The partial failure is accounted for
by two facts: (1)&nbsp;Simrock’s reputation as a scholar was not equal
to that of Grein or Heyne, nor had he the advantage of editing the text;
(2)&nbsp;the measure which the translation employed has never been
popular among readers. No German translation in imitative measures, with
the single exception of Grein’s (which has made its appeal as a
scholarly work and not as a piece of literature), has ever passed into a
second edition; while versions couched in iambic lines or Nibelungen
meters have been reprinted.</p>

Fourth German Translation. Iambic Pentameter.</p>


<h5>Heyne.</h5>

<p>The name of Moritz Heyne is one of the most illustrious in the
history of Beowulf scholarship. The Heyne editions of the text<a class =
"tag" name = "tag_heyne1" id = "tag_heyne1" href = "#note_heyne1">1</a>
have been standard for nearly forty years,
<span class = "pagenum">64</span>
while the translation has been recently reprinted (1898). Beside his
work on the <i>Beowulf</i>, this scholar was to become prominent as
editor of the <i>Heliand</i> and of <i>Ulfilas</i>, and as one of the
staff appointed to complete Grimm’s Dictionary.</p>

<p>At the time when he printed his edition of the <i>Beowulf,</i> Heyne
was a student at Halle, and but twenty-six years of age (born 1837)<a
class = "tag" name = "tag_heyne2" id = "tag_heyne2" href =
"#note_heyne2">2</a>. In his work he had some assistance from Professor
Leo<a class = "tag" name = "tag_heyne3" id = "tag_heyne3" href =
"#note_heyne3">3</a> of Halle.</p>


<h5><a name = "trans_heyne_relation" id = "trans_heyne_relation">
Relation of Text and Translation.</a></h5>

<p>The translation was founded on the text of 1863. At the time it was
by far the best edition that had yet appeared. It was furnished with an
excellent glossary. The text had the advantage of the valuable work done
by Grundtvig<a class = "tag" name = "tag_heyne4" id = "tag_heyne4" href
= "#note_heyne4">4</a> in collating the two transcripts made by
Thorkelin<a class = "tag" name = "tag_heyne5" id = "tag_heyne5" href =
"#note_heyne5">5</a>. It thus came a stage nearer the MS. readings than
any other existing edition, while it avoided the unnecessary conjectures
of the Danish editor.</p>

<p>Heyne’s text having been five times re-edited, the first edition of
the translation often fails to conform to readings which have been
introduced into the text in later editions; but the free nature of the
translation makes this of no great importance.</p>


<h5>Differences between the First and Second Editions of the
Translation.</h5>

<p>The differences between the two editions are not of much importance.
The translation is in general, though not always, brought up to the late
editions of the text,
<span class = "pagenum">65</span>
and some changes are made for the improvement of the meter.</p>

<p>The first edition contains 3201 lines; the second 3207. The theory
and aim of the translation are not changed at all.</p>


<h5>Aim of Heyne’s Translation.</h5>

<p>In this translation of the <i>Beowulf</i>, Heyne attempts to
popularize what he considers the most beautiful of the Old English
poems. He says of&nbsp;it&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
‘Es ist nicht die erste, die <ins class = "correction" title = "word is emphatic (gesperrt) in Heyne original">ich</ins> biete; gleichwol hoffe
ich es werde die erste sein, die auch einem grössern Publicum, das noch
nicht Gelegenheit hatte, sich mit den ältern Dialecten unserer Sprache
zu beschäftigen, verständlich ist. Die ältern deutschen Uebersetzer
haben, bei allen Verdiensten ihrer Arbeit, unserer neuhochdeutschen
Muttersprache teilweise übel mitgespielt.’ &mdash;Vorwort, iii.
</blockquote>

<p>With this in view, Heyne put his translation out in a form that would
make it accessible to all. This was in itself an innovation. The works
of Ettmüller<a class = "tag" name = "tag_heyne6" id = "tag_heyne6" href
= "#note_heyne6">6</a> and Simrock<a class = "tag" name = "tag_heyne7"
id = "tag_heyne7" href = "#note_heyne7">7</a> had been in a more
elaborate <i>format</i>, while Grein’s translation<a class = "tag" name
= "tag_heyne8" id = "tag_heyne8" href = "#note_heyne8">8</a> was not
only expensive, but encumbered with other work, and intended primarily
for the scholar.</p>


<h5>Nature of the Translation.</h5>

<p>Heyne chose a new medium for his version, the unrimed iambic line.
His aim being to get his book read, he avoided a literal translation,
and rendered with commendable freedom, though not with inaccuracy. He
used no strange compounds, and shunned an unnatural verse. Thus he
produced the most readable translation that has ever appeared in
Germany. Of his own attempt he says&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
‘Die vorliegende Uebertragung ist so frei, dass sie das für uns schwer
oder gar nicht genau nachzubildende <ins class = "correction" title =
"text reads ‘alliterierende’">allitterierende</ins> Versmass des
Originals gegen fünffüssige <ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘Iamben’">Jamben</ins> aufgibt, und zu Gunsten des
<span class = "pagenum">66</span>
Sinnes sich der angelsächsischen Wort- und Satzstellung nicht zu
ängstlich anschmiegt; dagegen auch wieder so genau, dass sie hoffentlich
ein Scherflein zum vollkommenern Verständniss des Textes beitragen
wird.’ &mdash;Vorwort, iii.
</blockquote>

<p>Heyne’s theory of translation is one that has been very little in
vogue in Germany. He has been criticized on all sides for his freedom.
Yet the criticism is undeserved. Heyne is never paraphrastic&mdash;he
never adds anything foreign to the poem. He merely believes in
translating the obscure as well as the simple ideas of his text. His
‘freedom’ seldom amounts to more than this&mdash;</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>Hē bēot ne āleh, l. 80 (he belied not his promise)</p>
<p>Was er gelobt, erfüllt er.</p>
</div>

<p>He occasionally inserts a word for metrical reasons, and sometimes,
in the interests of clearness, a&nbsp;demonstrative or personal pronoun,
or even a proper name (cf. l.&nbsp;500 of the extract).</p>

</div>

<p>The extract illustrates sufficiently the characteristics of Heyne’s
rendering. In the first place, attention may be called to the extreme
freedom of the verse, a&nbsp;freedom which at times makes the
composition verge upon prose. In the second place, the translation of
the Old English phrase <i>beadu-runen onband</i> should be noticed, and
compared with the translations of Ettmüller, Grein, and Simrock, who
have respectively&mdash;</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p><i>entband beadurunen</i></p>
<p><i>entband Streitrunen</i></p>
<p><i>Kampfrunen . . . entbinden.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Heyne is the only one who translates the phrase in such a way as to
make the words intelligible to a reader unacquainted with Old English.
Finally, it should be noticed that the translation is quite as accurate
as those which preceded it. Heyne certainly succeeded in his attempt to
make the poem more intelligible to the general reader than it had ever
been before. While not so serviceable to the scholar as Grein’s
translation, it is undoubtedly the most enjoyable of the German
versions.</p>

VON WOLZOGEN’S TRANSLATION</a></h3>

Angelsächsischen von Hans von Wolzogen. Leipzig: Philipp Reclam, jun.
(1872?).</p>

<p>Volume 430 of Reclam’s Universal-Bibliothek. Small 8<sup>o</sup>, pp.

Fifth German Translation. Imitative Measures.</p>


<h5>Concerning the Translator.</h5>

<p>Hans von Wolzogen (born 1848), popularly known as a writer on the
Wagnerian operas and as conductor of the <i>Bayreuther Blätter</i>,
translated three Germanic poems for Reclam’s ‘Bibliothek’:
<i>Beowulf</i>, 1872, <i>Der arme Heinrich</i>, 1873, and the
<i>Edda</i>, 1877. There is no evidence that he had any <i>special</i>
interest in Old English studies.</p>


<h5>Aim of the Volume.</h5>

<p>As expressed in the ‘Vorbemerkung,’ the aim of the translator was
(1)&nbsp;to provide a readable translation ‘für unser modernes
Publicum,’ and (2)&nbsp;to make a convenient handbook for the student,
so that the beginner, with Grein’s text<a class = "tag" name =
"tag_wolzogen1" id = "tag_wolzogen1" href = "#note_wolzogen1">1</a> and
the present translation, might read the <i>Beowulf</i> with no very
great difficulty. So von Wolzogen made his version ‘more literal than
Heyne’s, but freer than Simrock’s’ (p.&nbsp;1).</p>


<h5>Nature of the Translation.</h5>

<p>The translation is in alliterative measures, called by the translator
imitative of the Old English. Von Wolzogen is concerned for this feature
of his work, and is at pains to
<span class = "pagenum">69</span>
give what he considers a full account of the original verse as well as a
lengthy defence of alliteration. Archaic touches are occasional. The
names are ‘re-translated into German’ according to a system of which,
apparently, von Wolzogen alone holds the key:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
‘... diese angelsächsische Form selbst nur eine Uebertragungsform aus
den ursprünglich deutschen Namen ist, wobei manch Einer sogar sinnlos
verdreht worden, wie z.B. der Name des Helden selbst, der aus dem
deutschen Bärwelf, Jungbär, zum Beovulf, Bienenwolf, gemacht worden
war.’ &mdash;Vorbemerkung, p.&nbsp;5.
</blockquote>

<p>The account of the Fall of Hygelac and of Heardred, 2354&ndash;96, is
shifted to line 2207 (p.&nbsp;75).</p>


<h5>Text Used.</h5>

<p>The translation is apparently founded on one of Grein’s texts<a class
= "tag" name = "tag_wolzogen2" id = "tag_wolzogen2" href =
"#note_wolzogen2">2</a>, but the work is so inaccurate that exact
information on this point is impossible from merely internal
evidence.</p>

</div>


<h5>Criticism of the Translation.</h5>

<p>Von Wolzogen’s translation is hardly trustworthy. A&nbsp;specimen of
his free interpretation of the <i>Beowulf</i> diction may be seen in the
footnote on page 13, where he defines <i>horngēap</i> (i.e. ‘with wide
intervals between its pinnacles of horn’) as ‘hornreich,’ and translates
<i>hornreced</i>, ‘Hornburg.’ Inaccurate renderings of the Old English
have been noted above in italics. They reveal an especial difficulty
with the kenning, a&nbsp;device which von Wolzogen apparently did not
understand, since the entire translation shows an attempt to interpret
the kenning hypotactically. Had the translator been making a paraphrase,
inaccuracies like ‘muthige Meerfahrt’ and ‘ihr rangt mit dem Wasser’
might be excused; but in a translation which was avowedly literal (more
literal than Heyne’s) they appear to be due to nothing less than
ignorance and carelessness. To give one example from the thousand that
bear out the truth of this statement, we may cite line 561
(p.&nbsp;27),</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p class = "halfline">
<i>Ic him þēnode</i></p>
<p><i>deoran sweorde &nbsp; &nbsp; swā hit gedēfe wæs.</i></p>
</div>

<span class = "pagenum">71</span>
<p>which is translated,</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p class = "halfline">
dawider doch diente</p>
<p>Mein treffliches Schwert, das treu mir beistand. (p.&nbsp;27.)</p>
</div>

<p>This is not paraphrase; it is sheer misapprehension of the Old
English.</p>

<p>A similar misapprehension is seen in line 15 of the extract,</p>

<p class = "verse">
Mit Bitten und Warnen,</p>

<p>which we are asked to accept as a translation for</p>

<p class = "verse">
ne lēof nē lāð. (l. 511.)</p>

<p>The verse of von Wolzogen’s translation is the poorest of the German
attempts at imitative measures. The translator is obliged at times to
append footnotes explaining the scansion of his lines (see pp. 33, 34,
65, 91). The cesura is frequently not in evidence (cf. lines 14 and 22,
both of which are also metrically incorrect); the lines are often
deficient in length (p.&nbsp;29, line 26; p.&nbsp;31, line 19;
p.&nbsp;32, line&nbsp;19).</p>

ARNOLD’S EDITION</a></h3>

<p>Beowulf, a&nbsp;heroic poem of the eighth century, with a
translation, notes, and appendix, by Thomas Arnold, M.A. London:
Longmans, Green &amp; Co., 1876. 8<sup>o</sup>, pp. xliii, 223.</p>

<p class = "space">
Fourth English Translation. Prose.</p>


<h5>Circumstances of Publication.</h5>

<p>No edition of the text of <i>Beowulf</i> had appeared in England
since the work of Thorpe<a class = "tag" name = "tag_arnold1" id =
"tag_arnold1" href = "#note_arnold1">1</a>, now twenty years
<span class = "pagenum">72</span>
old. The textual criticism of the Germans had, meanwhile, greatly
advanced the interpretation of the poem. Grein’s text of the poem had
passed into a second, and Heyne’s into a third, edition. There was an
opportunity, therefore, for an improved English edition which should
incorporate the results of German scholarship. This edition Mr. Thomas
Arnold (1823&ndash;1900) undertook to supply.</p>


<h5>Relation of the Parts.</h5>

<p>The Introduction contained a new theory of the origin of the poem<a
class = "tag" name = "tag_arnold2" id = "tag_arnold2" href =
"#note_arnold2">2</a>. But the important part of the book was the text
and translation. There is no glossary<a class = "tag" name =
"tag_arnold3" id = "tag_arnold3" href = "#note_arnold3">3</a>. The notes
are at the bottom of the page. Here glossarial, textual, and literary
information is bundled together. There is a very inadequate bibliography
in the Introduction.</p>


<h5>Nature of the Translation.</h5>

<p>The translation is a literal prose version, printed under the text.
It resembles Kemble’s work<a class = "tag" name = "tag_arnold4" id =
"tag_arnold4" href = "#note_arnold4">4</a>, rather than Thorpe’s<a class
= "tag" name = "tag_arnold5" id = "tag_arnold5" href =
"#note_arnold5">5</a>. It eschews unwieldy compounds, and makes no
attempt to acquire an archaic flavor. Supplied words are bracketed.</p>


<h5><a name = "trans_arnold_crit" id = "trans_arnold_crit">
Criticism of the Text.</a></h5>

<p>Arnold had access to the MS., and gave the most thorough description
of it that had yet appeared. But, strangely enough, he did not make it
the basis of his edition. He speaks of a ‘partial collation’ of
the&nbsp;MS.,
<span class = "pagenum">73</span>
but this appears to have been nothing <ins class = "correction" title =
"text reads ‘mroe’">more</ins> than a transcription of certain
fragmentary parts of the MS. One of these passages is printed in the
Introduction, where it is referred to as an ‘exact transcript’; yet, in
collating it with the Zupitza <i>Autotypes</i>, I&nbsp;have found the
following errors:&mdash;</p>

<table class = "lines" summary = "details of translations">
<tr>
<td>Line 2219<a class = "tag" name = "tag_arnold6" id = "tag_arnold6"
href = "#note_arnold6">6</a>,</td>
<td>þeowes <i>for</i> þeofes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class = "number">2220,</td>
<td>biorn <i>for</i> beorna.</td>

<td>wea . . . <i>for</i> weal . . .</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class = "number">2226,</td>
<td>inwlitode, inwatode <i>for</i> mwatide.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Of course the faded condition of the MS. offers some excuse for one
or two of these errors, but, if we encounter mistakes in a short
transcript professedly exact, what would have been the fate of the text
had the entire MS. been collated?</p>

<p>Professor Garnett<a class = "tag" name = "tag_arnold7" id =
"tag_arnold7" href = "#note_arnold7">7</a> has noted that Arnold’s text
was taken from Thorpe’s, with some changes to suit the 1857 text of
Grein. In order to test the accuracy of these statements I have made a
collation of the texts of Arnold, Thorpe, and the MS. The list of errors
in Thorpe’s text, which I have mentioned in a discussion of that work<a
class = "tag" name = "tag_arnold8" id = "tag_arnold8" href =
"#note_arnold8">8</a>, is repeated bodily in Arnold’s. Yet there was no
excuse at this time for the retention of many of these readings.
Grundtvig<a class = "tag" name = "tag_arnold9" id = "tag_arnold9" href =
"#note_arnold9">9</a> had corrected several of them as early as 1861 by
his collation of the Thorkelin transcripts<a class = "tag" name =
"tag_arnold10" id = "tag_arnold10" href = "#note_arnold10">10</a>; Heyne
had got rid of them by collating Thorpe’s work with Kemble’s<a class =
"tag" name = "tag_arnold11" id = "tag_arnold11" href =
"#note_arnold11">11</a> and Grundtvig’s. Arnold makes almost no
<span class = "pagenum">74</span>
reference to the work of Heyne, and incorporates none of his
emendations. He also overlooked Grein’s 1867 text, which contained new
readings and a glossary. Arnold himself did not emend the text in a
single instance.</p>


<h4>Extract.</h4>

<h5 class = "smallroman">VIII.</h5>

<blockquote>
Hunferth spake, the son of Ecglaf, who sat at the feet of the master of
the Scyldings; he unbound the secret counsel of his malice. The
expedition of Beowulf, the valiant mariner, was to him a great cause of
offence; for that he allowed not that any other man on the earth should
ever appropriate more deeds of fame under heaven than he himself. ‘Art
thou that Beowulf who strove against Breca in a swimming-match on the
broad sea? where ye two for emulation explored the waves, and for
foolish boasting ventured your lives in the deep water. Nor could any
man, either friend or foe, warn you off from your perilous adventure.
Then ye two rowed on the sea, where with your arms [outspread] ye
covered the ocean-stream, measured the sea-ways, churned up [the water]
with your hands, glided over the deep; the sea was tossing with waves,
the icy wintry sea. Ye two toiled for seven nights in the watery realm;
he overcame thee in the match, he had more strength. Then, at dawn of
morn, the sea cast him up on [the coast of] the Heathoreamas; thence he,
dear in the sight of his people, sought his loved native soil, the land
of the Brondings, the fair safe burgh where he was the owner of folk,
burgh, and precious jewels.’ &mdash;Pages 37,&nbsp;38.

First French Translation. Prose.</p>


<h5>Old English Studies in France.</h5>

<p>The only attention that <i>Beowulf</i> had received in France prior
to this time was in the work of Sandras, <i>De Carminibus Cædmoni
adiudicatis</i><a class = "tag" name = "tag_botkine1" id =
"tag_botkine1" href = "#note_botkine1">1</a>. Other scholars, if they
devoted themselves to English at all, studied chiefly the later periods
of the literature<a class = "tag" name = "tag_botkine2" id =
"tag_botkine2" href = "#note_botkine2">2</a>. In 1867 the author of the
article on <i>Beowulf</i> in Larousse’s Dictionary could say, ‘Le poème
n’est pas connu en France.’ In 1876 Botkine published a historical and
critical analysis of the poem<a class = "tag" name = "tag_botkine3" id =
"tag_botkine3" href = "#note_botkine3">3</a>. This was the first
scholarly attention that the poem received in France. In the following
year Botkine’s translation appeared.</p>

<p>France has added nothing to our knowledge of <i>Beowulf</i>; there
has never been another translation, nor even a reprint of Botkine’s.
There has been no further scholarly work done on the poem; and the
principal literary notices of it, such as Taine’s and Jusserand’s, have
been notoriously unsympathetic. The genius of Old English poetry is at
the furthest possible remove from that of the French.</p>


<h5>Aim of the Translation.</h5>

<p>It will be made evident in the section that follows on the nature of
Botkine’s translation that his work could never
<span class = "pagenum">76</span>
have been intended for scholars. Had it been so intended, the translator
would have rendered more literally. His introduction<a class = "tag"
name = "tag_botkine4" id = "tag_botkine4" href = "#note_botkine4">4</a>
proves that the book was addressed to the general reader rather than the
student of Old English.</p>

<p>The Introduction deals with the nature of Old English poetry, and
makes historical and critical remarks on the <i>Beowulf</i>. There are
occasional notes explanatory of the text.</p>

<p>In his critical work the author is chiefly indebted to Grein<a class
= "tag" name = "tag_botkine5" id = "tag_botkine5" href =
"#note_botkine5">5</a> and Heyne<a class = "tag" name = "tag_botkine6"
id = "tag_botkine6" href = "#note_botkine6">6</a>.</p>


<h5>Nature of the Translation.</h5>

<p>The translation, which is in prose, is characterized, as the author
himself admits, by extreme freedom and occasional omission of words and
phrases. The author’s defence of these may be given here:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
‘Je crois devoir me disculper, en présentant cette première traduction
française de Beowulf, du double reproche qui pourrait m’être adressé
d’avoir supprimé des passages du poëme et de n’en avoir pas suffisamment
respecté la lettre. D’abord je dois dire que les passages que j’ai
supprimés (il y en a fort peu) sont ou très obscurs ou d’une superfluité
choquante. Ensuite, il m’a semblé qu’en donnant une certaine liberté à
ma traduction et en évitant autant que possible d’y mettre les redites
et les périphrases de l’original anglo-saxon, je la rendrais meilleure
et plus conforme à l’esprit véritable de l’œuvre. Est-ce sacrifier du
reste la fidélité d’une traduction que d’épargner au public la lecture
de détails le plus souvent bizarres et inintelligibles? N’est-il pas
plus logique d’en finir de suite avec des artifices poétiques inconnus à
nos littératures modernes, plutôt que de vouloir s’escrimer en vain à
les reproduire en français? Et alors même qu’on poursuivrait jusqu’au
bout une tâche si ingrate, pourrait-on se flatter en fin de compte
d’avoir conservé au poëme son cachet si indiscutable d’originalité? Non
certes.’ &mdash;Avertissement, p.&nbsp;3.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
‘Il ne faut pas oublier que, la langue française différant complètement
<span class = "pagenum">77</span>
par ses racines de l’anglo-saxon, il ne m’a pas été permis d’éluder les
difficultés de l’original comme on a pu le faire parfois en anglais et
en allemand.’ &mdash;Note, p.&nbsp;4.
</blockquote>

<p>It has been customary, in speaking of the work of M. Botkine, to call
attention to the numerous omissions. This is misleading. The passages
which the translator has omitted are not the obscure episodes or the
long digressions, but the metaphors, the parenthetical phrases, and
especially kennings and similar appositives.</p>

<p>For example, the original has:&mdash;</p>

<h5>Criticism of the Extract and Translation.</h5>

<p>If the translation is compared with the text, the reader will be
struck by the characteristic beauty of the words omitted. We may agree
with the translator regarding the difficulty of rendering compound and
kenning into French, and yet the very absence of an attempt to do this
jeopardizes the value of the translation more than the omission of many
episodes, for it brings it dangerously near to paraphrase. ‘Vous avez
nagé alors sur la mer, vous avez suivi les sentiers de l’océan,’ cannot
possibly be called a translation&nbsp;of&mdash;</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p class = "halfline">

<p>mǣton mere-strǣta, mundum brugdon,</p>
<p>glidon ofer gār-secg.</p>
</div>

<p class = "page">
ll. 512, ff.</p>

<p>A part of the story has been thrown away with the adjectives. The
force and beauty of the passage are gone.</p>

<p>But there is another danger in this paraphrastic method. In omitting
words and phrases, the translator will often misinterpret his original.
This is especially true of Botkine’s work in the obscure episodes where
he wishes to make the meaning perfectly clear. In attempting to simplify
the Old English, he departs from the original
<span class = "pagenum">79</span>
sense. Instances of this may be brought forward from the Finn
episode:</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p class = "halfline">
Folcwaldan sunu</p>
<p>dōgra gehwylce Dene weorþode,</p>
<p>Hengestes hēap hringum wenede,</p>

<p>fǣttan goldes, swā hē Frēsena cyn</p>
<p>on bēor-sele byldan wolde.</p>
</div>

<p class = "page">
ll. 1089 ff.</p>

<p>The idea is misinterpreted in Botkine’s&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
Le fils de Folcwalda (stipulait qu’il) leur ferait chaque jour une
distribution de trésors. (p.&nbsp;50.)
</blockquote>

<p>Again, at line 1117 it is said of the lady&mdash;</p>

<p class = "verse">
earme on eaxle &nbsp; &nbsp; ides gnornode,</p>

<p>meaning that the lady stood by the body (shoulder) of the corpse as
it lay on the pyre. Botkine makes of this&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
‘Elle poussait des lamentations en s’appuyant sur le bras de son fils.’
(p.&nbsp;50.)
</blockquote>

<p>The rendering is not without its amusing features, chiefly
illustrations of the inability of the French language to accommodate
itself to typically Germanic expressions. Thus when Hrothgar says what
is the equivalent of ‘Thanks be to God for this blessed sight,’ Botkine
puts into his mouth the words: ‘Que le Tout-Puissant reçoive mes
profonds remercîments pour ce spectacle!’ &mdash;which might have been
taken from a diplomatic note.</p>

Fifth English Translation. Ballad Measures.</p>


<h5>Differences between the two Editions, and Indebtedness to Preceding
Scholars.</h5>

<p>In the first edition of the translation a number of passages were
omitted. Some of these omissions were owing to corrupt text, some to
extreme obscurity of the original, and some merely to the fact that the
original was deemed uninteresting. The principal omissions were:
83&ndash;86; 767&ndash;770; 1724&ndash;1758; 1931&ndash;1963;
2061&ndash;2062; 2214&ndash;2231; 2475; 2930&ndash;2932;
3150&ndash;3156. These passages were inserted in the second edition.</p>

<blockquote>
‘In this edition I have endeavoured to remove some of the blunders which
disfigured its predecessor.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Some parts have been
entirely rewritten, and the passages formerly
omitted&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. have been inserted.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
A&nbsp;few notes have been added; and the introduction has been
materially altered and, I&nbsp;hope, improved.’ &mdash;Preface to the
Second Edition, p.&nbsp;v.
</blockquote>


<h5>Aim and Nature of the Translation.</h5>

<p>Lumsden’s desire was to produce a readable version of the poem. Thus
his work resembles that of Wackerbarth<a class = "tag" name =
"tag_lumsden2" id = "tag_lumsden2" href = "#note_lumsden2">2</a>; and,
like Wackerbarth, he couched his translation in ballad measures. Lumsden
does not vary his measure, but preserves the iambic heptameter
throughout. His lines rime in couplets.</p>

<p>No attempt is made to preserve alliteration or archaic diction.</p>

<p>The Introduction and Notes contain popular expositions of the work of
preceding scholars. Several of the Notes are original and well worth
while (see Notes A, C, G,&nbsp;M).</p>


<span class = "pagenum">81</span>
<h5>Texts Used.</h5>

<p>The translation is based on Grein’s text of 1857<a class = "tag" name
= "tag_lumsden3" id = "tag_lumsden3" href = "#note_lumsden3">3</a> and
Arnold’s text (1876)<a class = "tag" name = "tag_lumsden4" id =
"tag_lumsden4" href = "#note_lumsden4">4</a>. Garnett has shown<a class
= "tag" name = "tag_lumsden5" id = "tag_lumsden5" href =
"#note_lumsden5">5</a> that Lumsden ignored the 1867 text of Grein and
the editions of Heyne. These defects were remedied to some extent in the
second edition. Lumsden himself never emends the text.</p>


<h4>Extract<a class = "tag" name = "tag_lumsden6" id = "tag_lumsden6"

<h5 class = "smallcaps">IV. Hunferd and Beowulf.</h5>

<div class = "verse lines">
<p>Hunferd the son of Ecglaf spoke&mdash;at Hrothgar’s feet

<p>To none on earth would he allow a greater fame ’mong men</p>
<p>Beneath the heavens than his): ‘Art thou the same Beowulf then,</p>
<p>Who swam a match with Breca once upon the waters wide,</p>
<p>When ye vainglorious searched the waves, and risked your lives for
pride</p>
<p>Upon the deep? Nor hinder you could any friend or foe</p>
<p>From that sad venture. Then ye twain did on the waters row;</p>

<p>In waters’ might; but Breca won&mdash;he stronger was than thee!</p>
<p>And to the Hathoræms at morn washed shoreward by the flood,</p>

good,</p>
<p>And stronghold fair, where he was lord of folk and burg and
rings.</p>
<p>Right well ’gainst thee his vaunt he kept.</p>
</div>


<h5>Criticism of the Translation.</h5>

<p>The extract illustrates the paraphrastic nature of parts of the
translation. Lumsden frequently seems to feel it necessary to read a
meaning into the obscure lines and
<span class = "pagenum">82</span>
passages that do not easily lend themselves to translation; cf. lines
11, 12. At line 2258 Lumsden translates:&mdash;</p>

<div class = "verse lines">
<p class = "halfline">
The mail that bite of sword</p>
<p>O’er clashing shield in fight withstood must follow its dead
lord.</p>
<p>Never again shall corselet ring as help the warriors bear</p>
<p>To comrades far.</p>
</div>

<p>The Old English from which this passage is taken reads:&mdash;</p>

<div class = "verse lines">
<p>ge swylce sēo here-pād, &nbsp; &nbsp; sīo æt hilde gebād</p>
<p>ofer borda gebræc &nbsp; &nbsp; bite īrena,</p>
<span class = "linenum">2260</span>
<p>brosnað æfter beorne; &nbsp; &nbsp; ne mæg byrnan hring</p>
<p>æfter wīg-fruman &nbsp; &nbsp; wīde fēran</p>
<p>hæleðum be healfe.</p>
</div>

<p>The passage is certainly obscure, and the readings are not all
undoubted, but the words can never be tortured into meaning what Lumsden
tries to make them mean.</p>

<p>But it would be manifestly unfair to judge a translation addressed to
the general reader merely by scholarly tests. The work must make its
appeal as a literary rendering.</p>

<p>The propriety of adopting a ballad measure may be questioned.
Probably no measure could be found more unlike the Old English lines.
Moreover, by reason of its long association with purely popular poetry,
it constantly suggests the commonplace and the trivial. But above all,
it is reminiscent of a medievalism wholly different from that of
<i>Beowulf</i>.</p>

<p>The saving grace of the ballad measure is its readableness. It is
rather effective in passages not too dignified, calling for action. But
in passages of elevation the line is found wanting:&mdash;</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>They mourned their king and chanted dirge, and much of him they
said;</p>
<p>His worthiness they praised, and judged his deeds with tender
dread.</p>
</div>

<p>But, like Wackerbarth’s, Lumsden’s translation had the advantage of
being readable.</p>

<h5>Differences between the Editions.</h5>

<p>In the second edition the translation was collated with the
Grein-Wülker text, and wherever necessary, with the Zupitza
<i>Autotypes</i>. Additions were made to the bibliography:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
‘I have revised certain passages with a view to greater accuracy, but I
have not changed the plan of the work, for that would have necessitated
the re-writing of the whole translation.’ &mdash;Preface to the second
edition.
</blockquote>

<p>The third and fourth editions are simple reprints, with some
additions to the bibliography.</p>


<h5>Circumstances of Publication.</h5>

<p>As has been pointed out above in the sections on Arnold<a class =
"tag" name = "tag_garnett1" id = "tag_garnett1" href =
"#note_garnett1">1</a> and Lumsden<a class = "tag" name = "tag_garnett2"
id = "tag_garnett2" href = "#note_garnett2">2</a>, no satisfactory
literal translation of <i>Beowulf</i> existed in English. Furthermore,
an American translation had never appeared. It was with a view to
presenting the latest German interpretations of the poem
<span class = "pagenum">84</span>
that Garnett prepared his literal version of the poem. The original
draft of the translation was made at St. John’s College, Md., in the
session of 1878&ndash;79.&mdash;Preface to first edition.</p>


<h5>Texts Used.</h5>

<p>The translation is based on Grein’s text of 1867. Notes are added
showing the variants from Heyne’s text of 1879. In the second edition
notes are added showing the variants from the Grein-Wülker text of
1883.</p>


<h5>Method of Translation.</h5>

<p>The translation is intended for ‘the general reader’ and for the ‘aid
of students of the poem.’ &mdash;Preface to second edition.</p>

<p>The translation is a literal line-for-line version. Of this feature
of his work Professor Garnett says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
‘This involves naturally much inversion and occasional obscurity, and
lacks smoothness; but it seemed to me to give the general reader a
better idea of the poem than a mere prose translation would do, in
addition to the advantage of literalness. While it would have been easy,
by means of periphrasis and freer translation, to mend some of the
defects chargeable to the line-for-line form, the translation would have
lacked literalness, which I regarded as the most important object.’
&mdash;Preface to the first edition.
</blockquote>


<h5>Nature of the Verse-form.</h5>

<blockquote>
<ins class = "correction" title = "open quote invisible">‘In</ins>
respect to the rhythmical form, I&nbsp;have endeavored to preserve two
accents to each half-line, with cæsura, and while not seeking
alliteration, have employed it purposely wherever it readily presented
itself. I&nbsp;considered that it mattered little whether the feet were
iambi or trochees, anapæsts or dactyls, the preservation of the two
accents being the main point, and have freely made use of all the usual
licences in Early English verse.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. To attain this
point I have sometimes found it necessary to place unemphatic words in
accented positions, and words usually accented in unaccented ones, which
licence can also be found in Early English verse.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
While the reader of modern English verse may sometimes be offended by
the ruggedness of the
<span class = "pagenum">85</span>
rhythm, it is hoped that the Anglo-Saxon scholar will make allowances
for the difficulty of reproducing, even approximately, the rhythm of the
original. The reproduction of the sense as closely as possible had to be
kept constantly in view, even to the detriment of the smoothness of the
rhythm.’ &mdash;Preface to the first edition.

</div>


<h5>Criticism of the Translation.</h5>

<p>The translation, in its revised form, is throughout a faithful
version of the original text. The fault of Garnett’s
<span class = "pagenum">86</span>
translation is the fault of all merely literal
translations&mdash;inadequacy to render fully the content of the
original. The rendering may be word for word, but it will not be idea
for idea. Examples of this inadequacy may be given from the printed
extract. ‘Grief’ in line 502 is a very insufficient rendering of
<i>æf-þunca</i>, a&nbsp;unique word which suggests at once vexation,
mortification, and jealousy. Had the poet simply meant to express the
notion of <i>grief</i>, he would have used <i>sorh</i>, <i>cearu</i>, or
some other common word. In line 508 ‘pride’ hardly gives full expression
to the idea of <i>wlence,</i> which signifies not only <i>pride</i>, but
<i>vain pride, of empty end</i>. In line 517 ‘conquered’ is insufficient
as a translation of <i>oferflāt</i>, which means to <i>overcome in
swimming, to outswim</i>.</p>

<p>Examples of this sort can be brought forward from any part of the
poem. At line 2544 Garnett translates&mdash;</p>

<p class = "verse">
Struggles of battle when warriors contended,</p>

<p>a translation of&mdash;</p>

<p class = "verse">
Gūða . . . þonne hnitan fēðan</p>

<p>Here ‘hnitan fēðan’ refers to the swift clash in battle of two armed
hosts, a&nbsp;notion which is ill borne out by the distributive
‘warriors’ and the vague ‘contended.’</p>

<p>At line 2598 we find&mdash;</p>

<p class = "verse">
they to wood went</p>

<p>for</p>

<p class = "verse">

<p>which, whatever be the meaning of ‘bugon,’ is surely a misleading
translation.</p>

<p>The nature of the verse has been sufficiently illustrated by the
quotations from the author’s preface. It would seem from the way in
which the measure is used that it was a kind of second thought, incident
upon the use of a line-for-line translation. It is hard to read the

<h5>Reception of Garnett’s Translation.</h5>

<p>Garnett’s volume had a flattering reception. The book received long
and respectful reviews from the Germans. Professor Child and Henry Sweet
expressed their approbation. The book has passed through four editions.
This cordial welcome has been due in large measure to the increasing
attention given the poem in American colleges and secondary schools.
Being strictly literal, the book has been of value as a means of
interpreting the poem.</p>

<h5>Author’s Preliminary Remarks.</h5>

<blockquote>
‘Il poema consiste di 3183 versi fra cui alcuni in frammenti che noi
abbiamo cercato di completare senza alterare lettera del testo. Una mano
recente lo ha diviso in 43 canti, detti in ags. fitte; ne notiamo il
numero anche nella versione. I&nbsp;versi che il Müllenhoff reputa
interpolati, sono disposti in linee rientranti; quelli attributi ad A
portano di più questa lettera nella versione nostra interlineare, che
segue la parola del testo in maniera da mantenervi anche la sintassi,
e&nbsp;<ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘si’">sì</ins> che
nessuna parola d’un verso prenda posto in un’&nbsp;altra riga. Le
parentesi quadre [&nbsp;] segnano nel testo riempiture di lacune. Nella
versione sono queste segnate per lettere corsive.’ &mdash;Prefazione,
p.&nbsp;251.
</blockquote>


<h5>Texts Used.</h5>

<p>The translator makes use of all the texts and commentaries that had
appeared up to his time, and even goes so far as to emend the text for
himself (cf. lines 65, 665, 1107, 2561, 3150).</p>

<p>The Notes are rather full. They are sometimes merely explanatory;
sometimes there are discussions of the MS. readings, of proposed
emendations, of history, myth, &amp;c.</p>


<h5>Method of Translation.</h5>

<p>The translation is literal; the medium an imitative measure of four
principal stresses, varied occasionally by the expanded line. The
diction is simple.</p>

<h5>Criticism of the Translation.</h5>

<p>The present writer cannot attempt a literary criticism of the
translation.</p>

<p>In purpose and method this version may be compared with that of
Kemble<a class = "tag" name = "tag_grion1" id = "tag_grion1" href =
"#note_grion1">1</a> and of Schaldemose<a class = "tag" name =
"tag_grion2" id = "tag_grion2" href = "#note_grion2">2</a>. In each case
the translator was introducing the poem to a foreign public, and it was
therefore well that the translation should be literal in order that it
might assist in the interpretation of the original. There has been no
further work done on the poem in Italy<a class = "tag" name =
"tag_grion3" id = "tag_grion3" href = "#note_grion3">3</a>.</p>

<p>While the verse is not strictly imitative in the sense that it
preserves exactly the Old English system of versification, it aims to
maintain the general movement of the original lines. The four stresses
are kept, save where a fifth is used to avoid monotony. These ‘expanded
lines’ are much commoner in the Italian than in the Old English.</p>

First Swedish Translation. Imitative Measures.</p>


<h5>Aim of the Volume.</h5>

<p>The translator begins his introduction with a discussion of the
importance of <i>Beowulf</i> as a historical document. For this reason
he is especially interested in the episodes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
‘This important historical interest may then explain the reason for
translating the poem into Swedish, and also serve as an excuse for the
fact that in the translation the poetic form has not been considered of
first importance.’ &mdash;Inledning, p.&nbsp;3.
</blockquote>


<h5>Nature of the Translation.</h5>

<blockquote>
‘In the translation I have endeavored to make the language readable and
modern. A&nbsp;translation out of an ancient tongue ought never to
strive after archaic flavor in point of words and expressions. Since the
poet wrote in the language of his day, the translation ought also to use
contemporary language.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I&nbsp;have tried to follow
the original faithfully, but not slavishly. For the sake of clearness
the half-lines have often been transposed.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The
rhythm is still more irregular than the Old English. Alliteration has
generally been avoided.’ &mdash;Inledning, p.&nbsp;6.
</blockquote>


<h5>Texts Used.</h5>

<p>The author constructs his own text. He explains (p.&nbsp;6) that he
has in general taken the MS. as the basis of his text. He has emended by
making those changes which ‘seemed most necessary or most probable.’ In
places where this departure from the MS. has been made, he italicizes
the words of his translation.</p>

<h5>Circumstances of Publication.</h5>

<p>Sixteen years had elapsed since the publication of a scholarly
translation in England&mdash;for Lumsden’s<a class = "tag" name =
"tag_earle1" id = "tag_earle1" href = "#note_earle1">1</a> can hardly be
said to count as such. In the meantime Heyne’s text<a class = "tag" name
= "tag_earle2" id = "tag_earle2" href = "#note_earle2">2</a> had passed
into a fifth edition (1888); Wülker’s revision of Grein’s
<i>Bibliothek</i> had appeared with a new text of <i>Beowulf</i> (1881);
Zupitza’s <i>Autotypes</i> of the MS. had appeared 1882, making it
possible to ascertain exactly what was in the original text of the poem;
the studies of Sievers<a class = "tag" name = "tag_earle3" id =
"tag_earle3" href = "#note_earle3">3</a>, Cosijn<a class = "tag" name =
"tag_earle4" id = "tag_earle4" href = "#note_earle4">4</a>, Kluge<a
class = "tag" name = "tag_earle5" id = "tag_earle5" href =
"#note_earle5">5</a>, and Bugge<a class = "tag" name = "tag_earle6" id =
"tag_earle6" href = "#note_earle6">6</a> had been published, containing
masterly discussions of text revision. Some of these materials had been
used by Garnett in his translation, but the majority of them were of
later date.</p>


<h5>Aim of the Translation.</h5>

<p>Nothing is said in the introduction respecting the aim of the
translation; but it is evident from the Notes that the purpose was
twofold&mdash;to present the latest interpretation of the text, and to
afford a literary version of the poem.</p>


<h5>Texts Used.</h5>

<blockquote>
‘This translation was originally made from the Fourth Edition of Moritz
Heyne’s text. His Fifth Edition came out in 1888, and I think I have
used it enough to become acquainted with all the changes that Dr. Adolf
Socin, the new editor, has introduced. Where they have appeared to me to
be improvements, I&nbsp;have modified my translation accordingly.’
&mdash;Preface.
</blockquote>

<p>But the translator does not depend slavishly upon his text. He
frequently uses emendations suggested by the scholars mentioned above,
especially those of Professor
<span class = "pagenum">93</span>
Sophus Bugge in <i>Studien über das Beowulfsepos</i><a class = "tag"
name = "tag_earle7" id = "tag_earle7" href = "#note_earle7">7</a>; see
lines 457, 871, 900, 936, 1875, 2275.</p>

<p>The Introduction presents a new theory of the origin of the poem. The
notes are especially interesting because of the large body of quotations
cited for literary comparison and for the light they throw on Old
Germanic and medieval customs.</p>


<h4>Extract.</h4>

<h5 class = "smallroman">VIII.</h5>

<blockquote>
<i>Unferth the king’s orator is jealous. He baits the young adventurer,
and in a scoffing speech dares him to a night-watch for Grendel. Beowulf
is angered, and thus he is drawn out to boast of his youthful feats.</i>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Unferth made a speech, Ecglaf’s son; he who sate at the feet of the
Scyldings’ lord, broached a quarrelsome theme&mdash;the adventure of
Beowulf the high-souled voyager was great despite to him, because he
grudged that any other man should ever in the world achieve more
exploits under heaven than he himself:&mdash; ‘Art thou <i>that</i>
Beowulf, he who strove with Breca on open sea in swimming-match, where
ye twain out of bravado explored the floods, and foolhardily in deep
water jeoparded your lives? nor could any man, friend or foe, turn the
pair of you from the dismal adventure! What time ye twain plied in
swimming, where ye twain covered with your arms the awful stream, meted
the sea-streets, buffeted with hands, shot over ocean; the deep boiled
with waves, a&nbsp;wintry surge. Ye twain in the realm of waters toiled
a se’nnight; he at swimming outvied thee, had greater force. Then in
morning hour the swell cast him ashore on the Heathoram people, whence
he made for his own patrimony, dear to his Leeds he made for the land of
the Brondings, a&nbsp;fair stronghold, where he was lord of folk, of
city, and of rings. All his boast to thee-ward, Beanstan’s son soothly
fulfilled. Wherefore I anticipate for thee worse luck&mdash;though thou
wert everywhere doughty in battle-shocks, in grim war-tug&mdash;if thou
darest bide in Grendel’s way a night-long space.’
</blockquote>


<h5>Criticism of the Translation.</h5>

<p>As a whole, the translation may fairly be called faithful. The
emendations from which Professor Earle sometimes
<span class = "pagenum">94</span>
renders are always carefully chosen, and the discussions of obscure
lines in the poem are of real scholarly interest. But this is not always
true of the simpler passages of the poem. These are often strained to
make them square with the translator’s personal notions. Thus, at line
1723, Earle reads for</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p><i>Ic þis gid be þē āwraec</i></p>
<p>It is about thee . . . that I have told this tale,</p>
</div>

<p>adding in a note, ‘(In this passage) the living poet steps forward
out of his Hrothgar, and turns his eyes to the prince for whom he made
it up’ (p.&nbsp;168). Now this is nothing more than an attempt on the
part of the translator to wring from the Old English lines some scrap of
proof for the peculiar theory that he holds of the origin of the
poem.</p>

<p>Similarly, he often reads into a single word more than it can
possibly bear. At line 371 he translates&mdash;</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p><i>Hrothgar, helm Scyldinga,</i></p>
<p>Hrothgar, crown of Scyldings.</p>
</div>

<p>But ‘crown’ is an impossible rendering of ‘helm,’ which is here used
figuratively to denote the idea of protection<a class = "tag" name =
"tag_earle8" id = "tag_earle8" href = "#note_earle8">8</a>, rather than
the idea of the crowning glory of kingship. Further, in the same
passage, 375&ndash;6, <i>heard eafora</i> (bold son), is wrenched into
meaning ‘grown-up son.’ These are but two examples of what is common
throughout the translation.</p>


<h5>Diction.</h5>

<p>The archaic style used by Professor Earle cannot be regarded as
highly felicitous, since it mixes the diction of various ages. Here are
Old English archaisms like
<span class = "pagenum">95</span>
‘Leeds’ and ‘burnie’; here are expressions like ‘escheat,’ ‘page’
(attendant), ‘emprize,’ ‘bombard’ (drinking-vessel), ‘chivalry.’ Here
are such specialized words as ‘harpoon,’ ‘belligerent,’ ‘pocket-money,’
and combinations like ‘battailous grip’; while throughout the entire
translation are scattered modern colloquialisms like ‘boss’ (master),
‘tussle,’ ‘war-tug.’</p>

<p>The reason for these anomalies is evident&mdash;the translator wishes
to imitate the remoteness of the original style. The style is certainly
remote&mdash;at times almost as remote from the language of to-day as is
the style of <i>Beowulf</i> itself.</p>

<h5>Circumstances of Publication.</h5>

<p>Presented to the Philosophical Faculty of Johns Hopkins University in

late Professor in the college of William and Mary.</p>


<h5>Aim of the Translation.</h5>

<blockquote>
‘The work is addressed to two classes of readers.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
The Anglo-Saxon scholar he [the translator] hopes to please by adhering
faithfully to the original. The student of English literature he aims to
interest by giving him, in modern garb, the most ancient epic of our
race.’ &mdash;Preface, vii.
</blockquote>


<span class = "pagenum">96</span>
<h5>Nature of the Translation.</h5>

<p>The translation is in imitative measures and in archaic style.</p>

<blockquote>
‘The effort has been made to give a decided flavor of archaism to the
translation. All words not in keeping with the spirit of the poem have
been avoided. Again, though many archaic words have been used, there are
none, it is believed, which are not found in standard modern
poetry.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
‘The measure used in the present translation is believed to be as near a
reproduction of the original as modern English
affords.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The four stresses of the Anglo-Saxon verse
are retained, and as much thesis and anacrusis is allowed as is
consistent with a regular cadence. Alliteration has been used to a large
extent; but it was thought that modern ears would hardly tolerate it in
every line. End-rhyme has been used occasionally; internal rhyme,
sporadically.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
‘What Gummere calls the “rime-giver” has been studiously kept; viz., the
first accented syllable in the second half-verse always carries the
alliteration; and the last accented syllable alliterates only
sporadically.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
‘No two accented syllables have been brought together, except
occasionally after a cæsural pause.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Or,
scientifically speaking, Sievers’s C type has been avoided as not
consonant with the plan of translation.’ &mdash;Preface, viii,&nbsp;ix.
</blockquote>


<h5>Text.</h5>

<blockquote>
‘The Heyne-Socin text and glossary have been closely followed.
Occasionally a deviation has been made.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Once in a
while&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. (the translator) has added a conjecture of
his own to the emendations quoted from the criticisms of other students
of the poem.’ &mdash;Preface, vii.

<h5>Criticism of the Translation.</h5>

<p>The translation is faithful, but not literal. The chief difference,
for example, between this and the translation by Garnett is that Hall
makes an attempt to preserve the poetic value of the Old English words.
He is never satisfied with the dictionary equivalent of an Old English
expression. Thus, in the extract given above, ‘from vainest vaunting’ is
given as a translation of <i>dol-gilpe</i>&mdash;a&nbsp;great
improvement over Garnett’s rendering, ‘for pride.’ Similarly, ‘mixing
and stirring’ is given as a translation of <i>mundum brugdon</i>. This
method often leads the translator some distance, perhaps too great a
distance, from the Old English. The following may serve as examples of
the heightened color that Hall gives to the Old English
forms:&mdash;</p>

<p>Perhaps these paraphrastic renderings are what Dr. Hall is referring
to when he says in his preface, regarding the nature of the translation,
‘Occasionally some loss has been sustained; but, on the other hand,
a&nbsp;gain has here and there been made<ins class = "correction" title
= "close quote missing">.’&nbsp;</ins></p>

<p>As for the archaism, that is well enough for those who like it. It is
never so strange as that of Earle, or the marvelous diction of William
Morris. But it is not, therefore,
<span class = "pagenum">99</span>
dignified or clear. How much dignity and clarity a translator has a
right to introduce into his rendering is a matter of opinion. Mr. Hall
was quite conscious of what he was doing, and doubtless regarded his
diction as well suited to convey the original Beowulf spirit.</p>

<p>The chief criticism of the verse is that it is often not verse at
all. Many passages are indistinguishable from prose. This is a stricture
that cannot be passed on the Old English, nor on the best modern
imitations of&nbsp;it.</p>

in measures imitative of the Old English it is utterly out of place.

<h5>The Translator.</h5>

<p>In <i>Minerva</i> (1902), P. Hoffmann is recorded as ‘Ord. Professor’
of Philosophy and Pedagogy at Gent.</p>


<h5>Aim of the Volume.</h5>

<p>The translator desired to present a rendering of the poem that should
attract the general reader. He regarded Simrock’s version as too literal
and archaic<a class = "tag" name = "tag_hoffmann1" id = "tag_hoffmann1"
href = "#note_hoffmann1">1</a>, the version of von Wolzogen as not
sufficiently clear and beautiful<a class = "tag" name = "tag_hoffmann2"
id = "tag_hoffmann2" href = "#note_hoffmann2">2</a>, and the version of
Heyne as not sufficiently varied in form<a class = "tag" name =
"tag_hoffmann3" id = "tag_hoffmann3" href = "#note_hoffmann3">3</a>
(Vorwort,&nbsp;i). He regards the <i>Beowulf</i> as of great importance
in inspiring patriotism&mdash;he always calls the poem German&mdash;and
even offers a comparison of <i>Beowulf</i> with Emperor William I. With
the scholarship of his subject the author hardly seems concerned.</p>


<h5>Text, and Relation of Parts.</h5>

<p>The translation is founded on Grein’s text of 1867<a class = "tag"
name = "tag_hoffmann4" id = "tag_hoffmann4" href =
"#note_hoffmann4">4</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to the translation, the volume contains articles on the
history of the text, origin, the Germanic hero-tales, the episodes, the
esthetic value of the poem. These are decidedly subordinate in interest
to the translation.</p>


<h5>Nature of the Translation.</h5>

<p>The translation is in the so-called Nibelungen measures. Archaisms
and unnatural compounds are avoided.</p>

<p>The Finnsburg fragment is inserted in the text at line 1068,
p.&nbsp;44 of the volume. The episode is furnished with a beginning and
ending original with Hoffmann.</p>

<h5>Criticism of the Translation.</h5>

<p>Hoffmann’s translation is certainly not a contribution to
scholarship. It is a sufficient condemnation of the volume to quote the
words of the Vorwort:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
‘Die Uebersetzungen von Grein, Holder und Möller sind mir nicht
zugänglich gewesen, auch wie es scheint, nicht sehr bekannt.’
</blockquote>

<p>It is not surprising that Hoffmann is unacquainted with the
translations of Holder and Möller, as these works have
<span class = "pagenum">102</span>
never been made; but that a German translator should ignore the version
of Grein is a revelation indeed.</p>

<p>Even though a translator may not care to embody in his work any new
interpretations, it is nevertheless his duty to base his translation on
the best text that he can find. But apparently Hoffmann had never heard
of the Heyne editions of the text, nor of the Grein-Wülker
<i>Bibliothek</i>. He bases his translation on Grein’s text of 1867. He
evidently considered it a sufficient recommendation of his work to
associate with it the name of Grein, not troubling himself to discover
what advance had been made upon the work of that scholar.</p>

<h5>Literary Criticism.</h5>

<p>The translation resembles the work of Lumsden<a class = "tag" name =
"tag_hoffmann5" id = "tag_hoffmann5" href = "#note_hoffmann5">5</a> and
Wackerbarth<a class = "tag" name = "tag_hoffmann6" id = "tag_hoffmann6"
href = "#note_hoffmann6">6</a> in affording a version of the tale easily
readable. And the same criticism may be passed on the work of Hoffmann
that was passed on the two Englishmen.
<span class = "pagenum">103</span>
The style and medium chosen are not well fitted to render the spirit of
the poem. The <i>Nibelungenlied</i> is a poem of the late twelfth
century. The <i>Beowulf</i> at latest belongs to the eighth. To choose
for the translation of <i>Beowulf</i>, therefore, a&nbsp;medium
surcharged with reminiscence of a time, place, and style quite different
from those of the original is certainly an error. It may find an
audience where another and more faithful rendering would fail; but it
will never win the esteem of scholars. In his introduction Hoffmann
calls attention to the lack of variety in blank verse, but surely it
does not have the monotony inherent in a recurring rime and strophe.</p>

<p>Again, rime and strophe force upon the author the use of words and
phrases needed to pad out the verse or stanza. Attention must also be
called to the fact that the original seldom affords a natural pause at
the exact point demanded by the use of a strophic form. See the close of
the following stanzas in the Extract: I, III, IV, V. One effect of the
forced pause is that there is confusion in the use of kennings, which
often have to do duty as subject in one stanza and as object in another
stanza.</p>

<p>Commonplace expressions, incident perhaps upon the use of the
measure, are not unfrequent. Thus</p>

<p class = "verse">
Gesagt! gethan!</p>

<p>translates</p>

<p class = "verse">
ond þæt geæfndon swā (line 538).</p>

<p>Traces of this are also found in the extract; see beginning of last
stanza.</p>

<p>In conclusion, it may be said that Hoffmann’s version marks an
advance in one way only, readableness; and in this it is hardly superior
to Heyne’s rendering, which has the advantage of scholarship.</p>

<h5>Differences between the First and Second Editions.</h5>

<p>In the second edition a title-page is added. The running commentary,
printed in rubric on the margin of the first edition, is omitted.</p>


<h5>Text Used.</h5>

<p>The translation is, in general, conformed to Wyatt’s text of 1894,
departing from it in only a few unimportant details.</p>


<h5>Part Taken in the Work by Morris and Wyatt respectively.</h5>

<p>The matter is fortunately made perfectly clear in Mackail’s <i>Life
of William Morris</i>, vol. ii. p.&nbsp;284:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
‘(Morris) was not an Anglo-Saxon scholar, and to help him in following
the original, he used the aid of a prose translation made for him by Mr.
A. J. Wyatt, of Christ’s College, Cambridge, with whom he had also read
through the original. The plan of their joint
<span class = "pagenum">105</span>
labours had been settled in the autumn of 1892. Mr. Wyatt began to
supply Morris with his prose paraphrase in February, 1893, and he at
once began to “rhyme up,” as he said, “very eager to be at it, finding
it the most delightful work.” He was working at it all through the year,
and used to read it to Burne-Jones regularly on Sunday mornings in
summer.’
</blockquote>

<p>The plan of joining with his own the name of his principal teacher
was one which Morris had used before when translating from a foreign
tongue. He published his rendering of the <i>Volsunga Saga</i> as the
work of ‘Eirikr Magnússon and William Morris.’ There is no evidence that
Mr. Wyatt had any hand in forming the final draft of the translation. In
defending it, Morris took all the responsibility for the book upon
himself, and he always spoke of it as his own work. In writing to a
German student toward the end of his life Morris spoke of the
translation as his own without mentioning Mr. Wyatt<a class = "tag" name
= "tag_morris_wyatt1" id = "tag_morris_wyatt1" href =
"#note_morris_wyatt1">1</a>. Nor has Mr. Wyatt shown a disposition to
claim a share in the work. In the preface to his edition of the text of
<i>Beowulf</i> (Cambridge, 1894), he says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
‘Mr. William Morris has taken the text of this edition as the basis of
his modern metrical rendering of the lay.’ &mdash;Page xiii.
</blockquote>

<p>Finally, it may be added that the specimens of Mr. Wyatt’s
translation printed in the glossary and notes of his book bear no
resemblance to the work of Morris.</p>


<h5>Morris’s Theory of Translation.</h5>

<p>None despised the merely literal rendering of an epic poem more than
William Morris. In writing of his version of the <i>Odyssey</i> to
Ellis, Morris said: ‘My translation is a real one so far, not a mere
periphrase of the original as <i>all</i> the others are.’ In translating
an ancient poem, he tried to reproduce the simplicity and remoteness of
phrase which he found in his original. He believed it possible,
<span class = "pagenum">106</span>
e.g., to suggest the archaic flavor of Homer by adopting a diction that
bore the same relation to modern English that the language of Homer bore
to that of the age of Pericles. The archaism of the English would
represent the archaism of the Greek. This method he used in rendering
Vergil and Homer.</p>

<p>But when he approached the translation of <i>Beowulf</i>, he was
confronted by a new problem. It was evident that fifteenth-century
English was ill-adapted to convey any just notion of eighth-century
English. <i>Beowulf</i> required a diction older than that of Sir Thomas
Malory or Chaucer. Hence it became necessary to discard the theory
altogether, or else to produce another style which should in some true
sense be imitative of <i>Beowulf</i>. This latter Morris tried to
accomplish by increasing the archaism of his style by every means in his
power. This feature is discussed in the following section.</p>


<h5>Nature of the Translation.</h5>

<p>The translation of <i>Beowulf</i> is written in extremely archaic
language. An imitative measure of four principal stresses is used.
Wherever possible, the Old English syntax has been preserved (see line
1242); the word-order of the original is retained. The archaic language
is wrought of several different kinds of words. In the first place,
there is the ‘legitimate archaism,’ such as ‘mickle,’ ‘burg,’ ‘bairn’;
there are forms which are more closely associated with the translation
of Old English, such as ‘middle-garth,’ ‘ring-stem.’ There are modern
words used with the old signification, such as ‘kindly’ (in the sense
‘of the same kind’), ‘won war’ (in the sense ‘wage war’), ‘fret’ (in the
sense ‘eat’). Finally, there are forms which are literally translated
from Old English: ‘the sight seen once only’ from <i>ansȳn</i>, face,
251; ‘spearman’ from <i>garsecg</i>, ocean (see extract), ‘gift-scat’
from <i>gif-sceatt</i>, gift of money,
<span class = "pagenum">107</span>
378; ‘the Maker’s own making’ from <i>metod-sceaft</i>, doom, 1180.
Romance words are excluded whenever possible. A&nbsp;glossary of ‘some
words not commonly used now’ is included in the book, but none of the
words cited above, save ‘burg,’ is found in&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>Beanstan’s son, for thee soothly he brought it about.</p>
</div>


<h5>Criticism of the Translation.</h5>

<p>The Morris-Wyatt translation is thoroughly accurate, and is, so to
speak, an official commentary on the text
<span class = "pagenum">108</span>
of Wyatt’s edition. It is therefore of importance to the student of the
<i>Beowulf</i>.</p>

<p>As a literary rendering the translation is disappointing. In the
first place, it must be frankly avowed that the diction is frequently so
strange that it seems to modern readers well-nigh ridiculous. There are
certain sentences which cannot but evoke a smile. Such are:
‘(he)&nbsp;spoke a word backward,’ line 315; ‘them that in Scaney dealt
out the scat,’ line 1686.</p>

<p>Secondly, the translation is unreadable. There is an avalanche of
archaisms. One example of the extreme obscurity may be given:&mdash;</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>‘Then rathe was beroom’d, as the rich one was bidding,</p>
<p>For the guests a-foot going the floor all withinward.’</p>
</div>

<p class = "page">
l. 1975&ndash;76.</p>

<p>It would seem that the burden of ‘rathe,’ ‘beroomed,’ and
‘withinward,’ were sufficient for any sentence to carry, but we are left
to discover for ourselves that ‘rich one’ does not mean rich one, but
ruler, that the ‘floor’ is not a floor but a hall, and that the guests
are not guests, but the ruler’s own men.</p>

<p>Morris himself was conscious of the obscurity of the work:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
‘For the language of his version Morris once felt it necessary to make
an apology. Except a few words, he said, the words used in it were such
as he would not hesitate to use in an original poem of his own. He did
not add, however, that their effect, if slipped sparingly in amid his
own pellucid construction and facile narrative method, would be very
different from their habitual use in a translation.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
As the work advanced, he seems to have felt this himself, and his
pleasure in the doing of it fell off.’ &mdash;Mackail’s <i>Life</i>, ii.
284&ndash;5.
</blockquote>

<p>Finally, the version does not <i>translate</i>. Words like ‘Spearman’
for <i>Ocean</i>, and combinations like ‘the sight seen once only’ for
<i>the face</i>, can be understood only by the intimate student of Old
English poetry, and there is no reason why such a person should not
peruse <i>Beowulf</i> in
<span class = "pagenum">109</span>
the original tongue rather than in a translation occasionally as obscure
as the poem itself.</p>

<p>If one can peer through the darkness of Morris’s diction, he will
discover a fairly pleasing use of the so-called imitative measure. The
verse is not nearly so rough as the original; many of the characteristic
substitutions are avoided. There is evident a tendency toward the
‘rising verse’ and the anapestic foot. The feminine ending is frequently
used. The verse is, therefore, not strictly imitative in that it retains
the Old English system of versification, but rather in that it attempts
to suggest the Old English movement by the use of four principal
stresses and a varying number of unstressed syllables. Morris’s verse is
the best of all the ‘imitative’ measures.</p>

<h5>Criticism of the Translation.</h5>

<p>The translation seems to aim chiefly at accuracy, which accounts for
the rather large number of notes containing readings suggested by
various commentators. The translator uses freely compounds and metaphors
similar to those in the original text. This seems occasionally to
militate against the clearness of the work. Thus, it is doubtful whether
‘kampgeheim ontkeetnend’ of the extract conveys to the modern Dutch
reader any notion similar to that of the Old English <i>beadu-runen
onband</i>.</p>

<p>The present writer is unable to offer any literary criticism of the
translation.</p>

<h5>Criticism of the Translation.</h5>

<p>It would be manifestly unfair to criticize this translation for its
want of grace and melody, because it is avowedly a literal rendering,
and a literal rendering makes no attempt to attain these qualities. But
there are certain things which are indispensable in a good literal
translation. It is imperative that such a translation should be based on
the best text of the original poem. What has Steineck done? He has gone
back thirty-five years and chosen an early and inaccurate edition of a
work that has been five times re-edited, Heyne’s text of 1863! It seems
almost incredible that a German, living in the midst of scholars who
have done more than any other people to interpret the <i>Beowulf</i>,
should ignore the fruits of their efforts.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to enumerate the faults of this translation due to
dependence upon an antiquated edition of the text. Suffice it to say
that when the edition of 1863 was printed the text had not yet been
properly transcribed from the MS.<a class = "tag" name = "tag_steineck2"
id = "tag_steineck2" href = "#note_steineck2">2</a></p>

<p>But there are evidences of an inaccuracy of a different kind that
betray a carelessness utterly reprehensible. The
<span class = "pagenum">114</span>
author is apparently unable to transliterate properly the Old English
names. Thus he has Vealhpeon and Vealhpeo (for Wealhtheow), Ecgpeow,
Halbdaene (for Healfdene), Ermanarich, &amp;c.</p>

<p>In his attempt to produce an etymological document, the translator
uses many compounds such as even the German language might be better
without; such are&mdash;Sippenschar (sibbegedriht), 730; Schattenwandler
(sceadugenga), 704; Wangenpolster (hlēor-bolster), 689; Leibpanzer
(līc-syrce), 550. As compounds these may not be offensive to a German;
but the trouble with them is that they do not translate the Old English
ideas.</p>

<p>Finally, it may be asked why a translation that appeals only as a
literal rendering should not be strictly literal, noting its every
variation from the original, italicizing supplied words, holding to the
original word-order.</p>

<p>Steineck’s translation did not advance the interpretation of
<i>Beowulf</i> a whit. In point of accuracy the book is not worthy to
stand with good translations thirty years old.</p>

J. R. C. HALL’S TRANSLATION</a></h3>

<p class = "space">
Tenth English Translation. Prose.</p>


<span class = "pagenum">115</span>
<h5>Translator, and Circumstances of Publication.</h5>

<p>Hitherto Dr. Hall had been chiefly known to the learned world for his
excellent <i>Anglo-Saxon Dictionary for Students</i>.</p>

<p>Up to this time no prose translation had appeared in England since
1876, save Earle’s<a class = "tag" name = "tag_jrc_hall2" id =
"tag_jrc_hall2" href = "#note_jrc_hall2">2</a>, which for the elementary
student was practically useless. Moreover, this translation was the
first to embody the results of various studies on the poem during the
past decade.</p>


<h5>Contents.</h5>

<p>Unlike the preceding works on <i>Beowulf</i>, it may be said that the
introductory and illustrative matter in this book is of quite as much
importance as the translation. The author says of his book:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
‘The following pages comprise a short statement of what is actually
known with respect to the poem of <i>Beowulf</i>, another statement of
what seems to me most likely to be true amongst the almost innumerable
matters of conjecture concerning it, and a few words of literary
appreciation.’ &mdash;Introduction, p.&nbsp;ix.
</blockquote>

<p>Statements similar to these have been put forth by other translators
of the poem, but the material of their volume has not always borne them
out. The studies of the poem in the Introduction are sufficient for a
school edition of <i>Beowulf</i>&mdash;a&nbsp;similar body of
information is not found in any of the existing editions&mdash;while
annotations of some importance to the elementary student are found in
the notes and running comment. The book contains, beside the
translation, a&nbsp;discussion of the form, language, geographical
allusions, date, and composition of the poem, as well as a useful,
though inaccurate, bibliography<a class = "tag" name = "tag_jrc_hall3"
id = "tag_jrc_hall3" href = "#note_jrc_hall3">3</a>.</p>


<span class = "pagenum">116</span>
<h5>Text Used.</h5>

<p>The translation is founded on the text of A. J. Wyatt, Cambridge,
1894. Dr. Hall does not always follow the interpretations given in
Wyatt’s glossary, nor is the punctuation of the translation conformed to
that of the Old English text.</p>


<h5>Indebtedness to Preceding Scholars.</h5>

<p>In his translation Dr. Hall seems to be most indebted to the work of
Professor Earle<a class = "tag" name = "tag_jrc_hall4" id =
"tag_jrc_hall4" href = "#note_jrc_hall4">4</a> (see lines 4, 71, 517,
852, 870, 926, 996, 1213, 1507, 2021, 3034, &amp;c.).</p>

<p>Frequent reference is also made to the work of Cosijn,
<i>Aanteekeningen op den Beowulf</i> (1892). The work of other scholars,
such as Bugge, Heyne, Socin, is also referred&nbsp;to.</p>


<h5>Nature of the Translation.</h5>

<p>The translation is a literal prose version. It is constantly
interrupted by bits of running comment, designed to overcome the
inherent obscurity of the poem, or to afford an elaborate digest of the
story if read without the translation (p.&nbsp;7<ins class =
"correction" title = ") invisible">).</ins></p>

<p>The rendering avoids archaisms.</p>

<p>Bugge’s restoration is used at line 3150; the passage at line 2215 is

he grudged that any other man under heaven should ever obtain more glory
on this middle-earth than he himself.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
(506&ndash;528). <i>‘Art thou the same Beowulf,’ says he, ‘who ventured
on a foolhardy swimming match with Breca on the open sea in winter, for
seven days, and got beaten? A&nbsp;worse fate is in store for thee when
thou meetest Grendel!’</i>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
‘Art thou that Beowulf who strove with Breca, contested with him on the
open sea, in a swimming contest, when ye two for vainglory tried the
floods, and ventured your lives in deep water for idle boasting? Nor
could any man, friend or foe, dissuade you from your sorry enterprise
when ye swam on the sea; when ye compassed the flowing stream with your
arms, meted out the sea-paths, battled with your hands, and glided over
the ocean; when the sea, the winter’s flood, surged with waves. Ye two
toiled in the water’s realm seven nights; he overcame you at swimming,
he had the greater strength. Then, at morning time, the ocean cast him
up on the Heathoræmas’ land. Thence, dear to his people, he sought his
beloved fatherland, the land of the Brondings, his fair stronghold-city,
where he had subjects and treasures and a borough. The son of Beanstan
performed faithfully all that he had pledged himself to. So I expect for
thee a worse fatality,&mdash;though thou hast everywhere prevailed in
rush of battle,&mdash;gruesome war,&mdash;if thou darest await Grendel
at close quarters for the space of a night.’
</blockquote>


<h5>Criticism of the Translation.</h5>

<p>The extract is typical of all that is best in the translation. It is
a thoroughly accurate piece of work, failing only where Wyatt’s edition
of the text is unsatisfactory. Translations like ‘gave vent to secret
thoughts of strife’ and ‘thou hast prevailed in the rush of battle’ show
that the work is the outcome of long thought and deep appreciation. At
times the translation, as here, verges on a literary rendering. But in
this respect the first part of the poem is vastly superior to the later
parts, though all three are marred by extreme literalness. Dr. Hall did
not always escape the strange diction that has so often before
disfigured the translations of <i>Beowulf</i>:&mdash;</p>

</tr>
</table>

<p>It is also rather surprising to learn from Dr. Hall that Beowulf was
one of those that ‘advanced home government’ (l.&nbsp;3005).</p>

<p>It should be added that the explanatory comment which constantly
interrupts the translation, often six or eight times in a section, is
annoying, both because it distracts the attention and because it is
often presented in a style wholly inappropriate to the context.</p>

<p>But this absence of ease and dignity does not hinder Dr. Hall’s
translation from being an excellent rendering of the matter of the poem,
at once less fanciful than Earle’s<a class = "tag" name =
"tag_jrc_hall5" id = "tag_jrc_hall5" href = "#note_jrc_hall5">5</a> and

<h5>Aim of the Volume and Nature of the Translation.</h5>

<blockquote>
‘The present translation of <i>Beowulf</i> is an attempt to make as
simple and readable a version of the poem as is consistent with the
character of the original. Archaic forms, which have been much in favor
with translators of Old English, have been excluded, because it has been
thought that vigor and variety are not incompatible with simple,
idiomatic English.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
The principal ways in which the present version differs from a merely
literal translation are the following: (1)&nbsp;in a rather broad
interpretation of pregnant words and phrases; (2)&nbsp;in a conception
of some of the Old English compounds as conventional phrases in which
the original metaphorical sense is dead; (3)&nbsp;in a free treatment of
connecting words; (4)&nbsp;in frequent substitution of a proper name for
an ambiguous pronoun.
</blockquote>

The translation is based on the text of A.&nbsp;J. Wyatt (Cambridge,
1898); a&nbsp;few departures from his readings are enumerated in the
Notes.’ &mdash;Preface, pp. 5,&nbsp;6.

<h5>Contents of the Volume, and Nature of the Translation.</h5>

<p>This was the first German book to give any extended account of the
poem.</p>

<p>The titles of the chapters are: I. Historische Anlehnung; II.
Mythischer Inhalt; III. Die geographischen Angaben; IV. Genealogische
Verhältnisse der in dem Liede vorkommenden Helden; V. Uebersicht des
Inhalts des Gedichtes von Bëówulf. In this fifth chapter are found the
extracts from <i>Beowulf</i>. It will be seen that the chapter is
somewhat subordinate to the others, its chief purpose being to furnish a
kind of digest of the poem, to be used principally as a work of
reference. A&nbsp;desire to condense leads the translator to omit lines
that he does not deem essential to
<span class = "pagenum">122</span>
an understanding of the events and characters of the poem. Unfortunately
his omissions are often the most poetical lines of the <i>Beowulf</i>.
For example, he omits the description of Beowulf’s sea-voyage;
Hrothgar’s account of the haunt of Grendel and his dam is curtailed; the
dying words of Beowulf, perhaps the most beautiful lines in the poem,
are clipped. Further examples may be found in the extract given below.
This insufficiency is excused by the fact that Leo’s main object in
preparing the book was to prove certain theories that he held respecting
the origin and date of the poem.</p>

E. H. JONES’S PARAPHRASE</a></h3>


<p>Popular Romances of the Middle Ages. By George W. Cox, M.A., and

8<sup>o</sup>, <i>Beowulf</i> (by E. H. Jones), pp. 382&ndash;398.</p>

<p class = "space">
A Paraphrase for General Readers.</p>


<h5>Aim of the Volume.</h5>

<blockquote>
‘The thought that these old romances may be presented to Englishmen of
the present day in a form which shall retain their real vigour without
the repulsive characteristics impressed on them by a comparatively rude
and ignorant age may not, perhaps, be regarded as inexcusably
presumptuous. With greater confidence it may be affirmed that, if we
turn to these old legends or romances at all, it should be for the
purpose of learning what they really were, and not with any wish of
seeing them through a glass which shall reflect chiefly our own thoughts
about them and throw over them a colouring borrowed from the sentiment
of the nineteenth century.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
‘These two conditions have, it is hoped, been strictly observed in the
versions here given of some of the great romances of mediæval Europe.
While special care has been taken to guard against the introduction even
of phrases not in harmony with the original narratives, not less pains
have been bestowed on the task of preserving all that is essential in
the narrative; and thus it may perhaps be safely said that the readers
of this volume will obtain from it an adequate knowledge of these
time-honoured stories, without having their attention and their patience
overtaxed by a multiplicity of superfluous and therefore utterly irksome
details.’ &mdash;Preface, pp. vi, vii.
</blockquote>


<h5>Nature of the Paraphrase.</h5>

<p>The poem is relieved of all the episodes except the prolog and King
Hrothgar’s discourse. Sometimes these omissions seem unnecessary. It is
certainly a mistake to sacrifice the swimming-match, lively in its
narrative, dramatic in setting.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the author makes an attempt to preserve as much as
possible of the original style. So anxious is he to save every
picturesque word of the original, that he sometimes transfers
expressions from the passages which he is obliged to drop and inserts
them in other parts of the story.</p>


<span class = "pagenum">125</span>
<h4>Extract<a class = "tag" name = "tag_jones1" id = "tag_jones1" href =
"#note_jones1">1</a>.</h4>

<blockquote>
‘Away to the westward among the people of the Geáts lived a man,
strongest of his race, tall, mighty-handed, and clean made. He was a
thane, kinsman to Hygelác the Geátish chief, and nobly born, being son
of Ecgtheow the Wægmunding, a&nbsp;war-prince who wedded with the
daughter of Hrethel the Geát. This man heard of Grendel’s deeds, of
Hrothgár’s sorrow, and the sore distress of the Danes, and having sought
out fifteen warriors, he entered into a new-pitched ship to seek the
war-king across the sea. Bird-like the vessel’s swan-necked prow
breasted the white sea-foam till the warriors reached the windy walls of
cliff and the steep mountains of the Danish shores. They thanked God
because the wave-ways had been easy to them; then, sea-wearied, lashed
their wide-bosomed ship to an anchorage, donned their war-weeds, and
came to Heorot, the gold and jewelled house. Brightly gleamed their
armour and merrily sang the ring-iron of their trappings as they marched
into the palace.’ &mdash;Pages 384&ndash;5.
</blockquote>


<h5>Criticism of the Paraphrase.</h5>

<p>The object of a paraphrase is to present all the essential matter of
the original, in a style materially simpler than, though not unrelated
to, the original.</p>

<p>The matter of Mr. Jones’s paraphrase is not above criticism. It is
full of minor errors. In the extract, for example, the original does not
say that the heroes ‘donned their war-weeds,’ nor that there were
mountains on the shores of Denmark.</p>

<p>The style of the work is much better. It is throughout strong and
clear, not over-sentimental. It is, perhaps, too intimate; it savors
slightly of the <i>Märchen</i>. This absence of vigor and remoteness may
be due to the nature of the volume of which this paraphrase is only a
part.</p>

<h5>Criticism of the Extract.</h5>

<p>The translation is very free. Lines that are obscure in the original
are not allowed to be obscure in the translation, even if they have to
have a meaning read into them. For example, in the extract quoted above,
<i>beadu-runen onband</i> of the original is rendered ‘sucht’ er
Händel,’ thoroughly intelligible, but not accurate. There is at times a
tendency to paraphrase, or even to introduce an original sentence into
the poem. An example of this may be seen at the close of the first
canto:&mdash;</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p class = "halfline">
‘unerforschlich sind</p>
<p>Und dunkel oft die Wege des Geschickes<a class = "tag" name =

&mdash;Page 5, l.&nbsp;54.</p>
</div>

<span class = "pagenum">128</span>
<p>Words are occasionally omitted. In the extract above <i>ne lēof nē
lāð</i> (l.&nbsp;511) and <i>sunu Bēanstānes</i> (l.&nbsp;524) are
omitted in translation. There are no lines in the original which
correspond to the last line and a half of the extract.</p>

<p>Of course by adopting this method of translation the writer attains
his purpose. His poem is readable, but readable at the expense of
accuracy. As a paraphrase, the version is commendable; but it is hardly
of importance in any other way.</p>

A Paraphrase in English Prose.</p>


<h5>Aim of the Volume.</h5>

<blockquote>
‘I have not translated them (the poems) literally, but have told their
stories faithfully in simple language, with the special design of
interesting young people, although I am not without hope that they will
be read by some who can no longer be called young.’ &mdash;Prefatory
Note.
</blockquote>


<h5>Nature of the Paraphrase.</h5>

<p>The following parts are omitted: (1) All episodes except the Prolog;
(2)&nbsp;All lines that do not have to do directly
<span class = "pagenum">129</span>
with the story; (3)&nbsp;All the descriptive adjectives and kennings of
the poem.</p>

<p>Gibb seems to care nothing for the beauties of the style. How much he
has sacrificed may be seen by noting his rendering of the celebrated
description of Grendel’s haunt:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
‘I know not their home. It is in a dark lake overshadowed by trees. Into
that lake the stag will not plunge, even although the hounds are close
upon it, so fearful and unholy is the place.’
</blockquote>

<p>An illustration of the same thing may be seen by noting the omission
of phrases from the swimming-match.</p>


<h4>Extract.</h4>

<blockquote>
But Hunferth, the son of Ecglaf, who sat at the feet of King Hrothgar,
was displeased. He was grieved that any hero should come to the land
boasting that he could do what no one among the Danes could do. He said
scornfully to Beowulf&mdash;
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
‘Tell me, art thou the Beowulf whom Breca overcame in a swimming match?
I&nbsp;heard the tale. You both ventured out like foolish men among the
waves in the days of winter. For seven nights you swam together, but
Breca was the stronger. Thou wilt have a worse defeat shouldst thou
venture to meet Grendel in the darkness of the night.’ &mdash;Page 144.
</blockquote>


<h5>Criticism of the Paraphrase.</h5>

<p>In comparison with the work of Mr. Jones<a class = "tag" name =
"tag_gibb2" id = "tag_gibb2" href = "#note_gibb2">2</a>, it may be said
that Mr. Gibb’s paraphrase is fuller, reproduces more events, and
follows more faithfully the original order. He supplies fewer
explanatory words and sentences. But, on the other hand, Mr. Gibb’s
work, unlike Mr. Jones’s, has no merits of style&mdash;it is all on a
dead level of prose. Thus it sins against one of the laws of paraphrase:
that the writer, in relieving himself of the exacting duties of
translator, must present the story in a more literary and more truly
adequate medium. Mr. Gibb’s is one of the poorer paraphrases.</p>


<span class = "pagenum">130</span>
<h5>Indebtedness to Arnold.</h5>

<p>At page 280 of the concluding chapter, the author speaks of the
history and character of the poem. It will be found on reference to this
section that the author is a follower of the views set forth in the
edition of Mr. Thomas Arnold<a class = "tag" name = "tag_gibb3" id =

indebted to this book for much of his paraphrase, but the free character

<p class = "space">
The paraphrase is adapted from <i>Deutsche Heldensagen für Schule und
Haus</i>, by Dr. W. Wägner (Leipzig, 1881).</p>


<h5>Aim of the Book.</h5>

<p>From the nature of the changes made in the story, it is evident that
an appeal is made to younger readers. This is borne out by the statement
on p.&nbsp;9 of the Introduction.</p>


<span class = "pagenum">131</span>
<h5>Changes in the Story.</h5>

<p>The story does not pretend to do more than follow the most general
outlines of the original. The most important changes are in the first
division of the poem, where it would seem that no changes whatever were
needed. The principal additions are the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) A minstrel flees from plague-stricken Heorot, sails to the
Geatish land, and sings the terror wrought by Grendel, urging Beowulf to
come and save the people.</p>

<p>(2) The swimming-match is introduced into the action of the story,
with the <i>motif</i> radically altered. Breca is represented as winning
the match.</p>

<p>(3) The incident of Beowulf’s refusal of the crown is amplified and
introduced into the story at the opening of the third part.</p>

<p>(4) The story differs from the original in a number of minor
details.</p>


<h4>Extract.</h4>

<blockquote>
The minstrel tuned his harp and sang of Beowulf’s heroic deeds, and
prophesied that he would conquer and slay the monster of the morass.
This praise made Hunford, one of the courtiers, angry and jealous. He
said it was Breka, not Beowulf, that had won the golden chain<a class =
"tag" name = "tag_wagner_macdowall2" id = "tag_wagner_macdowall2" href =
"#note_wagner_macdowall2">2</a>; that the Gothic hero was undertaking an
enterprise that would very likely lead him to his death; and he advised
him to think twice before attacking Grendel. Upon this, Beowulf
exclaimed indignantly that he had won a good sword instead of the golden
chain, and that it was sharp enough both to pierce the hide of the
monster and to cut out a slanderous tongue.
</blockquote>


<h5>Criticism of the Paraphrase.</h5>

<p>The extract gives a good idea of the author’s sins of omission and
commission. It will be seen, for example, that the tone of the entire
passage is altered. The bit of repartee in the last sentence is wholly
foreign to the Beowulf manner, which is outright and downright&mdash;the
<span class = "pagenum">132</span>
very opposite of subtilty. The false manner is evident at once when we
compare the reply of the hero in the original, ‘Thou art the murderer of
thine own brethren, and thou shalt be damned in Hell. Wait till
to-night, and thou shalt see which of us is the stronger.’</p>

<p>The story is, if possible, more garbled than the style. The mission
of the minstrel and the mangled account of the swimming-match have no
essential or artistic relation to the context. They are merely inserted
to add to the action of the piece.</p>

<p>The popularity of the book is attested by the number of editions
through which it has passed. The volume contains also paraphrases of the
legends about Arthur, Charlemagne, and Tannhäuser, as well as the story
of the Nibelungs. These must account for its enduring success; but it is
unfortunate that this, the poorest of the Beowulf paraphrases, should
thus have found an audience which it did not deserve and could never
have commanded for itself.</p>

<h5>Therese Dahn.</h5>

<p>Therese Dahn, born Freiin von Droste-Hülshoff, was born in 1845, and
married Felix Dahn in 1873. With him she published in 1873 at Leipzig a
volume of poems (<i>Gedichte</i>). For certain of her verses in this
volume she received high praise. She has since continued creative work.
She resides at Breslau, where Felix Dahn is professor in the University.
Of the stories in the present volume she wrote, beside <i>Beowulf</i>,
<i>Die Wölsungen</i>, <i>Kudrun</i>, the story of König Wilkinus,
&amp;c., <i>Wieland der Schmied</i>, <i>Walther und Hildgund</i>, and
the stories from the <i>Dietrich</i> saga and the <i>Nibelungen</i>
saga.</p>


<h5>Nature of the Paraphrase.</h5>

<p>The following parts of the story are omitted entirely: the account of
the first King Beowulf in the Prolog; the Sigemund episode, Hrothgar’s
Discourse; the Thrytho episode; the Freawaru episode; Beowulf’s account
of his Fight with Grendel as told to King Hygelac; the Battle of
Ravenswood.</p>

<p>Other changes in the story are as follows: the sorrows of the Danes
as told in the Prolog are attributed to the reign of King Heremod; in a
separate Kapitel (III) are gathered the Sorrows of King Hrethel, the
account of Ongentheow, the Fall of Hygelac, and the Death of Heardred.
The Fight at Finnsburg is added and an original beginning provided
for&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>Obscure words, phrases, and lines are omitted; and explanatory words
are inserted from time to time.</p>


<h5>Indebtedness to Simrock.</h5>

<p>The translation was evidently made with Simrock’s translation<a class
= "tag" name = "tag_dahn2" id = "tag_dahn2" href = "#note_dahn2">2</a>
in hand; possibly it may have been made directly
<span class = "pagenum">134</span>
from that version. Evidence of the dependence upon Simrock may be found
at every step. The forms of the proper names invented by Simrock are
repeated here (e.g., Aeskhere, Hädkynn, Ochthere). His renderings of the
unique words in the poem (sometimes in a slightly simplified form) are
used in the paraphrase. Often the original word used by Simrock is added
in parentheses (cf., e.g., Simrock, p.&nbsp;72.6 with Dahn, p.&nbsp;382,
and p.&nbsp;73.44 with Dahn, p.&nbsp;383). Further evidence may be found
by comparing the extracts given in this work.</p>


<h4>Extract.</h4>

<blockquote>
<i>Hunferd</i>, des Königs erster Sänger, hub da ein Streitlied an; ihm
war Beowulfs Ankunft leid: denn er liebte es nicht, dass ein ihn anderer
an Ruhm übertreffe.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
‘Bist du der Beowulf, der einst im Wettkampf mit <i>Breka</i> durch die
See schwamm? Wo ihr tollkühn in vermessenem Mut euer Leben in den tiefen
Wassern wagtet? Weder Freund noch Feind konnten euch abhalten. Da
rudertet ihr in den Sund, masset die Meeresstrassen, schlugt die Wasser
mit den Händen, über die Tiefen gleitend. Die winterkalte See stürmte
und brauste: sieben Nächte schwammt ihr im Wasser. Breka besiegte dich:
er hatte mehr Kraft. Die Hochflut warf ihn am nächsten Morgen ans Land,
von we er in seine Heimat eilte, in das Land der <i>Brondinge</i>, wo er
über Burg und Volk gebietet.’ &mdash;Page 370.
</blockquote>


<h5>Criticism of the Paraphrase.</h5>

<p>In many places the work is practically a translation, so closely has
the original been followed. The style is agreeable and simple; but most
of what is beautiful in the diction belongs to Simrock rather than to
Frau Dahn.</p>

<p>The omissions are the most sensible that I have found in a
paraphrase. Nothing of first importance has been lost.</p>

<h5>Reasons for including this Book.</h5>

<p>This volume is included here because of the great influence it has
had in forming popular notions regarding the <i>Beowulf</i>. The
eminence of Mr. Brooke as a critic and as a poet has given him the
attention of an audience hardly commanded by any other writer included
in this paper.</p>

<p>Again, the number of lines actually translated by Mr. Brooke is equal
to that in many of the volumes described in this section.</p>


<h5>Difference between the two Editions.</h5>

<p>The account in the second volume is much shorter than that in the
first; only twelve pages are given to the story of Beowulf, while the
first volume gives forty-three. The later book omits all discussion of
the episodes, and, although parts of the older volume are retained, the
matter is, in general, re-written.</p>


<span class = "pagenum">136</span>
<h5>Method of Translation.</h5>

<p>Translated extracts accompany the story as told by Mr. Brooke.</p>

<p>In his Preface (p. ix), the author speaks of the futility of prose
translations of poetry, and of the inadequacy of modern English media
for translating the spirit of the poetry. Finally he adopts a line which
he hopes will ‘fulfil the needs and follow closely the peculiarities’ of
Old English.</p>

<blockquote>
‘I chose after many experiments, the trochaic movement used in this
book, each half-line consisting of trochees following one another, with
a syllable at the end, chiefly a long one, to mark the division of the
line. I&nbsp;varied the line as much as I could, introducing, often
rashly, metrical changes; for the fault of this movement is its
monotony. I&nbsp;have sometimes tried an iambic movement, but rarely;
for this trochaic line with a beat at the end of each half-verse seemed
to me to get the nearest to the sound of the Anglo-Saxon line, even

<h5>Criticism of the Translation.</h5>

<p>While the extracts cannot always be praised for their accuracy, they
are, perhaps, sufficiently faithful for a popular work. When the author
undertakes to emend the text for himself, or offers an original
interpretation, his work is not always trustworthy. Emendations in his
Beowulf selections, however, are rare.</p>

<p>The style of the extracts seems needlessly obscure. This is due in
part to following too closely the original word-order (see lines 4 and 5
of the extract), and in part to the free use of archaic language. Mr.
Brooke does not hesitate to employ such forms as, ‘house-carles,’
‘grit-wall,’ ‘ness-slopes,’ ‘host-shafts,’ ‘war-wood,’ ‘gold-flakèd
shields,’ ‘grinning-masked helms,’ which it would seem must be quite
unintelligible to the majority of Mr. Brooke’s readers.</p>

<p>The verse, which has been fully discussed above, is, perhaps, the
most satisfactory feature of Mr. Brooke’s work. Of course it is not
strictly imitative, as he himself explains, but it gives a fairly good
impression of the movement of the Old English verse.</p>

MISS RAGOZIN’S PARAPHRASE</a></h3>

<p>Tales of the Heroic Ages. Siegfried, the Hero of the North, and
Beowulf, the Hero of the Anglo-Saxons, by Zenaïde A. Ragozin. G. P.
Putnam’s Sons, New York and London, 1898. 8<sup>o</sup>, <i>Beowulf</i>,
pp. 211&ndash;323, with Note at p.&nbsp;323, and with four illustrations
by George T. Tobin.</p>

<p>School Edition, New York, W. B. Harison, 1900.</p>

<p class = "space">
A Paraphrase in English Prose.</p>


<h5>The Author, and the Aim of her Book.</h5>

<p>Miss Zenaïde Alexeievna Ragozin, a Russian by birth, an American by
adoption, has devoted herself to the popularization of history and
mythology. In the series <i>Stories of the Nations</i>, she has
published, <i>The Story of Chaldea</i>, <i>The Story of Assyria</i>,
<i>The Story of Media, Babylon, and Persia</i>, <i>The Story of Vedic
India</i><ins class = "correction" title = "text has superfluous close quote">. </ins>Of late she has turned her attention to the mythology of
the various European nations, and has written of Siegfried, Frithjof,
and Roland.</p>

<p>The object of her work may be given in her own words:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
‘(The series is) intended as parallel reading to history, and planned to
illustrate history.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Great changes are coming over
the schools,&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. changes in the right direction, which
may shortly amount to a revolution, when there will be no reason why
these <i>Tales of the Heroic Ages</i> should not, although addressed to
young people at large, find a place, if not in the school curriculum, at
least in the wide margin of so-called ‘Supplementary Reading.’ May they
prove acceptable, not alone to the young, to whom they are specially
addressed, but also, as has been felicitously said, to “the old with
young tastes.”’ &mdash;Pages xx, xxii.
</blockquote>


<span class = "pagenum">139</span>
<h5>Method of Paraphrase.</h5>

<blockquote>
‘(The style) should be simple and epical; faithfully following the main
lines, bringing out also the characteristic details&mdash;the poetical
beauties, picturesque traits, and original dialogue, as much as may be
consistent with necessary condensation and, frequently, elimination. It
should be a consecutive, lively narrative, with the necessary
elucidating explanations incorporated in the text and with the fewest
and briefest possible footnotes, while it should contain no critical or
mythological digressions.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. What we want in telling
it to the young, is to take the epic just as it is, condensing and
expurgating, but not changing; rendering the characters, scenes and
situations with the faithfulness and reverence due to the masterpiece of
a race; using as much as possible, especially in the dialogue, the words
of the original.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. (The language) should be simple,
though not untinged with quaintness, and even in places a certain degree
of archaism.’ &mdash;Pages xvi, xix, xxi.
</blockquote>


<h5>Indebtedness to Earle.</h5>

<blockquote>
‘Professor Earle’s<a class = "tag" name = "tag_ragozin1" id =
"tag_ragozin1" href = "#note_ragozin1">1</a> version has been fully
utilized in the present volume, even to the extent of frequently making
use of its wording, where it is not too archaic or literal for ordinary
purposes.’ &mdash;Page 330, footnote.
</blockquote>

<p>Some notion of the extent of this borrowing may be had by examining
the extract printed below and the criticism that follows.</p>


<h4>Extract.</h4>

<blockquote>
Yet there was one eye that gleamed not with merriment and goodwill, one
head that hatched no friendly thoughts, because the heart swelled with
malice and envy. Unferth it was, the king’s own story-teller, who sat at
his feet, to be ready at all times to amuse him. He broached a
quarrelsome theme&mdash;an adventure in Beowulf’s youth, the only
contest in his record the issue of which, though hard fought, might be
called doubtful. For this Unferth was an envious wight, whose soul
grudged that any man should achieve greater things than himself.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
‘Art thou not,’ he began tauntingly, ‘that same Beowulf who strove with
Breca on open sea in a swimming-match, in which ye both
<span class = "pagenum">140</span>
wantonly exposed your lives, and no man, either friend or foe, could
turn you from the foolish venture? A&nbsp;se’nnight ye twain toiled in
the realm of the waters, and, if I err not, he outdid thee in swimming,
for he had greater strength. Wherefore I fear me much that thou mayest
meet with sorry luck if thou darest to bide here for Grendel for the
space of a whole night.’
</blockquote>


<h5>Criticism of the Paraphrase.</h5>

<p>It may be inferred from the dependence upon the work of Earle that
Miss Ragozin’s knowledge of Old English is of the slightest. This
inference is borne out by frequent misapprehension of the original
sense, due in large measure to the use of a single translation. Thus on
page 245, Grendel is called ‘the God-sent scourge,’ and, again, on
p.&nbsp;322, Beowulf is described as having been ‘most genial to his
nobles.’ Both of these errors are due to misapprehension of Professor
Earle’s translation. The list of proper names on p.&nbsp;331 reveals an
ignorance of some fundamental facts of Old English pronunciation. Of
course, an intimate knowledge of the Beowulf style and diction is not
indispensable to the writer of a paraphrase, but the writer who has it
will naturally be superior to the writer without it. For illustration,
Miss Thomson<a class = "tag" name = "tag_ragozin2" id = "tag_ragozin2"
href = "#note_ragozin2">2</a> never misinterprets a passage as does Miss
Ragozin on page 264, where nearly every sentence is false to the Beowulf
manner.</p>

<p>The paraphrase is slightly disfigured by the distinctively Romance
words which disfigure Earle’s translation.</p>

<p>But these slight defects need not blind us to the service done by
Miss Ragozin in making Beowulf accessible to school children. The style
is, in general, strong and effective, not without some of the beauty and
dignity of the Old English, but relieved of the more obscure and
recondite features of that style.</p>

</blockquote>


<h5>Nature of the Paraphrase.</h5>

<p>All obscure words (especially kennings) and lines are dropped. Many
explanatory remarks are inserted to elucidate the story. All speeches
are greatly shortened. Beowulf’s tale of the fight is omitted entirely.
The episodes are omitted, with the exception of the Sigemund episode,
one-half of which is translated into heroic couplets, and the Finn
episode, which is referred to in a single stanza which paraphrases the
story.</p>


<h5>Concerning the Author.</h5>

<p>The Rev. Alfred John Church (born 1829) is known chiefly for his
popularizations of the classics. His best-known works are <i>Stories
from Homer</i> and <i>Stories from Virgil</i>.
<span class = "pagenum">142</span>
The present volume is an attempt to do for some of the Germanic legends
what had already been done for Homer and Virgil.</p>


<h4>Extract.</h4>

<blockquote>
But while they feasted envy stirred in the heart of Unferth, son of
Ecglaf. He was the King’s orator, and he took it ill that Beowulf should
have come to the land of the Danes on this great enterprise, for he was
one who could not endure that any man under heaven should do greater
deeds than himself. Therefore he stood up in the hall and spake: ‘Art
thou that Beowulf who contended with Breca in swimming on the open sea?
‘Twas, indeed, a&nbsp;foolhardy thing so to put your lives in jeopardy,
yet no man could turn you from your adventure. Seven days and nights ye
toiled, one against the other, but he in the end prevailed, for he had
the greater strength. And on the eighth morning the waves cast him
ashore on the land of the Heathoram, whence he journeyed back to the
city of the Bronding, of which he was lord. So did Breca, son of
Beanstan, make good his boast against thee.’
</blockquote>


<h5>Criticism of the Paraphrase.</h5>

<p>The extract is so much fuller than the other parts of the paraphrase
that it hardly gives a fair notion of the nature of the work. The author
has appreciated the dramatic quality of the swimming episode and
preserved it nearly entire. Other parts of the story are much less
fortunate.</p>

<p>A little knowledge of Old English would have done the author no harm,
and would have saved him from some errors. His most evident mistakes are
in the forms of the proper names. Such forms as these occur in his book:
Veleda, Hugon, Weopstan (sic), Hrethin, Hrethet.</p>

<p>The diction is unfortunate. The coast-warden becomes a ‘squire’
(p.&nbsp;7); Heorot is a ‘banqueting hall’ (p.&nbsp;4, showing the
influence of Kemble’s translation); Beowulf and Breca were ‘pages at the
King’s court’ (p.&nbsp;13, showing the influence of Earle’s
translation).</p>

<p>Petty inaccuracies occur throughout, such as, ‘I counsel
<span class = "pagenum">143</span>
that thou refuse not’ (p.&nbsp;9); ‘A faithful squire must needs know
the troubles of his lord’ (p.&nbsp;7). In point of accuracy this version
is quite inferior to the work of Miss Thomson<a class = "tag" name =
"tag_church3" id = "tag_church3" href = "#note_church3">3</a>; and in
point of style and atmosphere to that of Mr. Jones<a class = "tag" name

Ragozin<a class = "tag" name = "tag_church5" id = "tag_church5" href =

and the author’s name will doubtless serve to give it a certain
success.</p>

<h5>Aim of the Volume.</h5>

<blockquote>
‘It is meant mainly to arouse in children an interest in the beginnings

in schools. It makes no pretension to being an adequate or satisfactory
version for grown-up readers.’ &mdash;Page&nbsp;6.
</blockquote>


<h5>Method of Paraphrase.</h5>

<blockquote>
‘[Discrepancies in the poem] I have endeavoured to smooth over by
omission or by very slight additions; and whenever of two readings of a
doubtful passage, one is more easily comprehensible than the other,
I&nbsp;have always adhered to this, even if on philological grounds it
seems less probable.’...
<span class = "pagenum">144</span>

<p>‘Many of the episodes in the story have been greatly shortened or
altogether omitted, since they interrupt the course of the narrative, or
divert the interest from the main theme.’ &mdash;Pages 5,&nbsp;6.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This statement is more modest than need be. It will be found that
only two of the episodes are passed without mention&mdash;the Prolog and
the Tale of Thrytho. The Legend of Sigemund and the Tale of Finn are
rather fully treated, and the Story of Freawaru and the Battle of
Ravenswood are both referred to. In each case the episodes are carefully
woven into the story, and that without superfluous words.</p>

<p>The words and sentences which are supplied are very carefully chosen,
and most of them have a prototype somewhere in the poem.</p>


<h4>Extract.</h4>

<blockquote>
Now, though most of Hrothgar’s men rejoiced to see Beowulf, and honoured
him for his generous thought in coming to their help, there was one who
looked on him with dislike and envy, and was jealous of the favour shown
him by the king. This was Hunferth, who was sitting on the daïs at
Hrothgar’s feet. And when he heard what this visitor intended to do, he
grew angry and moody, because he could not bear that any other man on
earth should obtain greater honour than he himself. So he began to rake
up old tales that he had heard of Beowulf, and tried to turn them to his
hurt, saying scornfully:

<p>‘Art thou that Beowulf who once strove on the wide sea in a
swimming-match with Breca, when ye two in boasting dared to breast the
wave, and for vainglory risked your lives in the deep water? There was
no man, friend nor foe, who could dissuade you from that sorrowful
journey; but ye swam in the surf, stretching out your arms over the
waves, and stirring up the surge with your hands. So did ye glide across
the ocean, while the waves weltered in wintry storms, and for seven
nights ye laboured in the tumult of the seas. But in the end the victory
was with Breca, for his might was the greater. Then on the morning of
the eighth day the tide bore him to the shore of Norway, whence he
visited his beloved home, the fair city of safety, where he ruled over
many people, over towns and treasure. Truly he did perform all his boast
against thee.’</p>
</blockquote>


<span class = "pagenum">145</span>
<h5>Criticism of the Paraphrase.</h5>

<p>In the opinion of the present writer, no better paraphrase of
<i>Beowulf</i> exists.</p>

<p>It is perhaps unfortunate that the word ‘translated’ is used on the
title-page, for this is misleading. The proper form is that used on the
cover of the book, ‘Beowulf, told by Miss Clara Thomson.’</p>

<p>It were sufficient praise to point out that the author has contrived
to retain practically all of the poem, without ever falsifying its
spirit by introducing a superabundance of explanatory phrases<a class =
"tag" name = "tag_thomson2" id = "tag_thomson2" href =
"#note_thomson2">2</a>. She is always true to the story (as Miss
Ragozin<a class = "tag" name = "tag_thomson3" id = "tag_thomson3" href =
"#note_thomson3">3</a> is not, for example, in the first section of her
work); she is equally true to the spirit of the poem (as Mr. Gibb<a
class = "tag" name = "tag_thomson4" id = "tag_thomson4" href =
"#note_thomson4">4</a> is not). The style is both vigorous and simple,
not unworthy of the story it tells.</p>

<p>It will be surprising if Miss Thomson’s work is not popular in
England, and the book should be known and used in this country.</p>
